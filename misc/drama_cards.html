The cards are sorted into different “values” - copper, silver, gold and platinum; generally reflecting how rarely you should award these cards. As a rule of thumb, a good ratio would one of 8:4:2:1, so that the copper cards show up a great deal more often. Whatever the case, I recommend you only use these cards if you’re confident as a GM.</em></p> <p><em>The cards are also sorted by type of action - Adventure, Assist, Attack, Combat, Defense, Movement, Recovery, Subplot and Meta; these categories are pretty self-explanatory, and their purposes for drama cards are deliberately vague; it’s just another means to allow you to sort through cards you may or may not want your players to have access to, or perhaps only use in certain situations.</em></p> <p><em>Using a card itself, in-game, takes no action, although there are cards that can only be used under special circumstances. There is no limit to how many cards a player may have, or how many a player may use at any given time; however, once again, this is just how I’m using them; you can limit a player to a set “hand” of cards, forcing them to discard a card if they want a new one, you may limit how many can be used at once, or when they can be used. Find the way they best suit your campaign, and use them as you see fit.</em></p> <p><em>If you don’t want to print each low-rarity card multiple times, or for some online solutions, you may prefer to roll for card rarity. In that case, you should use the following guidelines:</em></p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table> <thead> <tr> <th>d20</th> <th>Rarity</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1-10</td> <td>Copper</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11-16</td> <td>Silver</td> </tr> <tr> <td>17-19</td> <td>Gold</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>Platinum</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>If you want to suggest some new cards, feel free to hit me up on Discord !</p> <h2 id="copper-cards"> <a href="#copper-cards" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Copper Cards </h2> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="small-numbers-table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Code</th> <th>Name</th> <th>Subtype</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>C01</td> <td>Vigor</td> <td>Drama - Recovery</td> <td>Use this card when you would suffer a Critical Hit, and before a Reaction.
