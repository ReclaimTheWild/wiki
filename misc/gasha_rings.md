While there can be Magical Tools in the form of rings, the Rings listed in this section are of a special variant, since they have been grown instead of crafted and bestow its wearer unique magical effects. To differentiate between regular magical rings and grown Rings, the latter are commonly called **Gasha Rings**.

Characters can have as many Gasha Rings as they can carry (occupying Tool slots in the pouch as normal), but can only effectively equip one at the same time. To do so, a character must get "attuned" to it by taking an Extended Rest and, at the end of it, deciding on which of the Gasha Rings the character possesses they should attune to. Once attuned to a Gasha Ring, they occupy a "Gasha Ring" slot and no longer occupy the Tool slot in the character's pack as long as they're attuned to it. Gasha Rings will automatically fit the character's finger perfectly once attuned, so there's no need to make sure it's the right size during crafting.

Some Gasha Rings must be activated before their effect can be unleashed, noted by (*Activated*) behind the Gasha Ring's name. Unless otherwise stated, activating a Gasha Ring takes a Free Action to do so.

Rank 0 Gasha Rings count as Rank 1 Gasha Rings for effects, but after attuning to them, they crumble to dust at the end of the next Extended Rest.

Crafting a Gasha Ring costs 1 Gem and 3 Metals of the Gasha Ring's Rank and requires a cooking vessel. You may only craft a Gasha Ring of a Rank equal to (your Enchanting / 2), rounded down, and all Materials used must be of a Rank equal to the Gasha Ring's Rank or higher. Once crafted, the character gains a **Gasha Seed** with a color and Rank corresponding to the Gem used. The Seed must be planted in soft soil. Once done so, the Seed instantly sprouts and after a number of days equal to (Gasha Ring's Rank + 1), the sprout becomes a small tree carrying a Gasha Nut. Picking the Gasha Nut makes the tree disappear into the ground, as if its growth would suddenly reserve rapidly. The soft soil becomes usable again. Then, the Gasha Nut can be simply cracked open to reveal the crafted Gasha Ring.

Gasha Seeds must be planted in the same biome as the Gem used for crafting it would normally be found (for example, if an Opal has been used, a character should seek out soft soil on beaches or next to rivers). If the Gasha Seed has been planted in an ill-suited environment, the sprout instead takes a number of weeks equal to (Gasha Ring's Rank + 1) to grow into a tree.

The market value for Gasha Rings is the same as for Mundane Tools. Gasha Seeds have half that market value, but you don't know what Gasha Ring will sprout from it if bought - you only know the Gem used for crafting and the Rank of the Gasha Ring inside. Several people have been tempted by a cheap high-ranking Gasha Seed only to get a useless Cursed Ring in return, so beware.
