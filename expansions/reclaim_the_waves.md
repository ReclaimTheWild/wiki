# Reclaim the Waves {% include labels/wip %}

Reclaim the Wild is an upcoming setting module for the Great Sea featuring sailing ships and nautical adventures. It will include maritime "subrace" variations of the core races as well as a cast of new Secondary races, along with an entire array of new spells, feats, techniques, songs, and equipment.

Here's a link to the Reclaim the Waves development server on Discord.
