# Adventure Ideas: Granting Property {% include labels/version-agnostic %}
{: .no_toc }

Using the *Rebuild the Wild* supplement, Heroes can gain homes or become business-owners. But there are more ways to gain property than just planting a flag in the ground and deciding to construct a building! In fact, Heroes might prefer to own property in a cozy village or a bustling city – places where you can’t just claim a plot of land willy-nilly. And where there are NPCs, and rewards to be earned, there’s opportunity for adventure.

* **The Heroes have been tasked by the Rowen Trading Guild** to remove a corrupt member of theirs, Gesimund, who owns the only Weapon Shop for miles. Gesimund controls a band of back-alley brigands, preventing others from buying or selling weapons in his territory (and also, unbeknownst to the bandits, ensuring there’s always a demand). The Guild is sick of the complaints from other merchants, but can’t afford the fallout or the risk of directly acting against him. The Heroes could deal with him by roughing up his ruffians, cutting off his supply chain, or even buying him out. Once Gesimund is gone, the Rowan Trading Guild might decide to give his old shop’s license to the Heroes – not just to reward them, but to keep them close at-hand.
* **Clearing an Inn of unwanted monsters is a rite of passage for many novice Heroes.** In this case, the Inn has been abandoned for more than a year because of those fiends. They might simply be an infestation of rats, a group of bandits who’ve set up a hideout in the Inn’s forgotten basement, or ghosts who need to be put to rest. Whatever the cause of the Inn’s abandonment, once it’s cleared up… well, if nobody is able or willing to claim the Inn, maybe the Heroes can take it for themselves.
* **Old Man MacGregor was a farmer with the heart of an adventurer.** Before he passed away, he created a scavenger hunt, and hid the deed to his farm as the prize at the end of it, in the hopes that at least one of his children would feel the call to adventure… But whether for lack of interest, lack of skill, or lack of love for the old man, all of his children failed, and the farm fell into disrepair. But the tale of Old Man Macgregor’s trail of clues is still told in pubs and inns for miles around – and if some enterprising Heroes were to come along and follow those clues, they could claim the farm’s deed for themselves.
