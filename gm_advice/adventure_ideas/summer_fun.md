It’s officially summer! Everyone’s been working hard all year – it’s time to head out to the beach, enjoy some sunshine, and take a break from your worries and your work.

It’s no different for Heroes in *Reclaim the Wild* – just like us, they could use a break from deadly dungeons, mind-bending puzzles, and hordes of evil foes. But if your Heroes aren’t getting up to their usual adventures… just what *are* they going to do on the beach?

Today, we’re presenting something a little different – small adventure ideas that are much more low-stakes, chill, and mundane, perfect for a ‘beach episode’ of your campaign. So grab a cold drink, find an umbrella to sit under, and read on!

## Hyrule's Races on the Beach

While each member of a Race in Hyrule is their own unique individual, their unique racial lore and biology lend themselves to enjoying different activities when they find themselves on a beautiful, sandy beach. Below are some examples, just to get your inspiration flowing.

* **Gerudo** warriors may be unused to the sea, let alone swimming in the ocean. But they are *well acquainted* with sand. For them, building sandcastles is a field of artistic competition and pride. Don’t be surprised if two Gerudo get into a kind of artistic grudge-match, attempting to build ever-grander sand-sculptures or nigh-unassailable sand-forts. (Pint-sized **Fairies**, or those with access to the *Minish Minuet* Song, may match the scale of these epic sandcastles, and exploring them like a funhouse or a realtor – if they aren’t soaking in a cool, fruity drink like it’s their personal pool.)
* **Gorons** may be just as unfamiliar with the sea as the Gerudo, but for them, sand is just as enjoyable. Gorons might treat loose sand like others treat the water, rolling and lounging in it to cool off. Don’t be surprised if they set off a few Bombs beneath the sands, too, just to enjoy the cool sand-spray.
* **Rito** enjoy the warm air of the beach and the cool air of the ocean, rising and falling with the winds. They (and any friendly **Deku Scrubs**) might enjoy parasailing, tying themselves to a boat and letting the wind pick them up and effortlessly carry them for miles.
* **Sheikah**, Twili, and Demons are more likely to stay to the shade, and watch others as they pass by. They can spend a whole afternoon just commenting on the dress, drinks, and foibles of pedestrians. If they *must* step out into the sun, expect darkened glasses, hats, and copious lotion.
* **Zora** are at home on the beach, though they may be more used to the water than the sand – for them, lounging on land with friends might be a unique treat. Zora youths often play ball-games in the water: They may try to keep the ball from touching the water for as long as possible (not unlike volleyball or hackeysack), or they may use it in a game of ‘Fireball’, where they must jump from the water and kick or throw the ball at other Zora, swimming on the surface of the water.

## Carouse

Your Heroes may be spending time on the beach, but they might not be the only ones. A little friendly competition can go a long way towards injecting some action into a low-stakes session!

First, you might have some minigames along the boardwalk. Popular pasttimes might include games of darts, water-guns, ring-toss, or the like – much like a carnival or festival.

You might also have some more summertime-specific contests or competitions. Building sandcastles, surfing, triathalons, even eating contests, might be available for Heroes to test their mettle on.

Depending on who’s organizing these contests, you might run them as true Minigames (see *Rebuild the Wild*), or simply as Extended Trait challenges, with some prize (and some pride) offered at the end.

## Adventure

Of course, just because you’re relaxing on the beach, doesn’t mean you can’t go on an adventure, too!

If you’re aiming for that relaxing vacation atmosphere, first think about what kind of feeling you’re going for with the adventure. You might make the adventure “comedic”, like an anime’s beach episode; or maybe “heartwarming”, a nice palette cleanser after spilling blood and grimacing over the fate of the world.

With that decided, try to pick a theme or element that highlights how this adventure on the beach is different than your typical day in the wild. A secluded grotto, a popular food-cart, two rival schools on a field trip…

Often, once you have the feeling you’re aiming for and the element you’re exploring, you’ll already be halfway to figuring out the main problem that the Heroes will be solving on their quest. But if you don’t know what that is yet, this is a good time to figure it out! We suggest keeping it low-stakes – a vacation adventure shouldn’t be about saving the world, but about helping raise the spirits of your players and their Heroes.

## Tokens

Just because you’ve spent a day at the beach, relaxing and enjoying one another’s company, doesn’t mean you haven’t advanced your legend. (After all, future tellers of your tales might regale their audience with how your Heroes conquered sand and sea and became even closer friends!)

So long as the you and your players have had fun, the session should be worth at least one Token of Heroism, or even the usual handful. As the Game Master, be kind and generous in handing out Tokens after a day at the beach – you want to end on a high note, after all!
