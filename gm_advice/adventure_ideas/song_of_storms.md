The Zelda franchise has more than its fair share of memorable, catchy songs, each with its own potent magic. Of these, the Song of Storms might be the most well-remembered, inspiring people to create remixes, covers, and even their own lyrics for the Magical Song.

While the Song of Storms is rolled into the Wind’s Requiem in *Reclaim the Wild*, that doesn’t mean you can’t base a few adventures around it. Players will be sure to follow up any quest hook that’s flavored with this favorite song, in the hopes of learning it for themselves.

* **The desert town of Sunken Dune relies on the skilled dancer Palanhi**, playing the Song of Storms, for their survival. The town receives no natural rainfall, and the nearest oasis is three days’ travel away. When desert thieves kidnap Palanhi away, the town is beside itself with panic. When the Heroes valiantly rush in to try and rescue her, however, they learn a startling truth – Palanhi *asked* to be kidnapped. The Heroes can either return her to her gilded cage, learn the song (and perhaps teach it to someone else in town), or, perhaps, find some more permanent solution to the town’s water problem.
* **A strange clock-maker is visiting Zora’s Domain, and selling music boxes for cheap.** Everyone loves their tinkling tunes, and they echo off of the grotto walls beautifully. However, the music boxes hide a secret: they’re actually a clever kind of time bomb. In less than a day, the music boxes will all change their tune to the Song of Storms, and begin playing simultaneously. This will surely flood the Zora’s homeland, and cause a cascading torrent to wash away everything downstream, the question remains – *why?*
* **The town of Ilghaz has an annual festival for the Song of Storms.** At the opening ceremony, the town’s choir gathers at an ancient monument, and sings the Song of Storms together, symbolically washing away the town’s sins. This year, however, the rains are red, and full of toads – an ill omen, to be sure. Is it truly a potent of bad things to come? A sign of some strange effect in the local lake? Or perhaps, as the town’s Mayor insists, some kind of magical prank?
