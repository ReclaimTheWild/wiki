Companions are great to bring along on heroic adventures, but the gear-based progression in *Reclaim the Wild* does not always fit with certain companions. For some people, a Dog wielding a rank 3 Sword would be cool; for others, this does not fit with the image they have for their furry friend. Regardless, a Dog attacking with their teeth (a rank 1 Natural Dagger) would likely be more of a hindrance in combat than an asset after a certain point.

For players who want their Companions to keep pace with their Heroes, without resorting to giving their faithful hounds and horses actual armor and weapons, we present this system! It’ll let your Companions improve their damage and defense, without all becoming Okami.

## Natural Weapon Upgrade

Much as Natural Weapons are treated like Weapons with a Weapon Spirit for recovering durability, you can upgrade them in a similar manner.

Like with the Talking Animal’s *(Magical) Armed* bonus, Natural Weapons can be improved to a Rank of up to ((unboosted Discipline + unboosted Fortitude) / 4) using 4 Monster Parts of the appropriate rank.

| Discipline + Fortitude | Max. Natural Weapon Rank |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2                      | 1                        |
| 6                      | 2                        |
| 10                     | 3                        |
| 14                     | 4                        |
| 18                     | 5                        |

When you use this method, think a bit about how you might be improving your faithful companion’s Natural Weapon. Maybe you’re sharpening and polishing their teeth, or you’re performing alchemical rituals to harden their hooves. However your Hero goes about it, the result is the same: your Companion’s Natural Weapon is now stronger than before, but still wholly part of their own body.

At your GM’s discretion, you can provide an appropriate weapon style to your Companion’s Natural Weapon(s).

## Natural Armor Upgrade

Although regular Armor can be crafted and placed on a Companion, Armor may not fit with the aesthetic of a particular creature. As such, you may want to find another method of improving your Companion’s Defense so they don’t fall in one blow.

### Upgrade Armor

Unlike Natural Weapons, there are no rules for upgrading Armor. However, it can be easily extrapolated from the rules for upgrading Natural Weapons and crafting Armor.

The trait requirement is the same as upgrading your Natural Weapon (see the table above). However, the Material cost is different. See the table below.

| Defense Level          | Material Cost |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Civilian               | 4             |
| Light, Medium or Heavy | 8             |
| Extreme or Impervious  | 12            |

Much like upgrading a weapon, you must upgrade your companion’s Natural Defense by one step.

Typically, this cost will be in Monster Parts. However, certain Monsters (typically Arcane and Mechanical Monsters) may use different Materials as determined by the GM.

As examples:
* Armos Statues may use Metal or Stone
* Guardians may use Ancient Materials
* Hikkun may use Metal
* Magmanos may use Stone or Rubies
* Papetto may use Metal or Wood

Similar to upgrading Natural Weapons, the exact method of upgrading Natural Armor can vary depending on the player and the recipient. An artificial being like an Armos or Papetto can simply have the Materials attached or sculpted to their bodies; a Guardian’s armor plating may simply be replaced; or an alchemical ritual can toughen up the scales or hide of a beast.

## Changelog

March 10, 2020:
* “Use Unarmored Defense” and “Ignore Low Defense” sections removed due to rediscovering a section about Companion Defense in the core rulebook. You may find them in my draft on Google sheets, if you have reason to look at them.
