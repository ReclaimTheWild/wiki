## Overview

Average Height: 2’ to 10’  
Average Weight: 20 lbs to 400 lbs  
Life Span: Unknown  
Shell Colors: Any, but mainly Black, Green, Pink, Red, White  
Eye colors: White, Red  
Head decorations: Caps, keys, screens, steering wheels, wicks  

Play a Bob-omb if you want…
* … to make things explode.
* … to struggle to figure out how to solve things without explosions even though you totally could just explode right now.
* … to explore the strangeness of life as a metallic being in a world of fleshy people.

**Weakness**: Fire  
**Bonuses**:
* **Bomb**: You gain the Bomb ability. See below for details.
* **Metallic Shell**: As a mechanical creature, you are made out of metal. By default, you are always a valid target for lightning strikes, can be interacted with magnetically, and can even become Corroded. You Corrode after you are damaged when in water. See the section below on the Corroded status.
* **Mechanical Muncher**: You can consume Metals as if they were Food ingredients of the same rank, including being able to eat Dishes made with those same Metals. (Metals do not contain special properties when cooked.) Bob-ombs can also ingest oil with no issues at all. 

Select two of the following options:

* **Aerodynamic**: An ally can grab and toss you as a standard action, should you be willing; a foe can toss you only after they have you grappled. You can be thrown with the Throw 1H Weapon basic attack if you are smaller than the thrower; otherwise, you can be thrown with the Throw 2H Weapon basic attack. For the purposes of these basic attacks, your accuracy is 3, and your Weapon Attack is equal to your Combat trait.
* **Bowling Bomb**: You can Shield Surf without the need of a shield, by simply falling onto yourself and rolling. Instead of Durability damage, you can spend Stamina at the same rate. If you run out of Stamina, you can then Spend Health.
* **Chuck-Ya**: You gain the Companion Chucker and Fastball Special techniques.
* **Hydrodynamic**: You become a Natural Swimmer.
* **Manufacture Bomb**: You learn the Lesser Manufacture Bomb technique.
* **Roly-poly**: You can get up from Prone by only spending 1 Movement instead of half.
* **Wick Lantern**: You can keep your wick lit without necessarily detonating. You can emit Dim Light from burst 0 (illuminating only yourself) to burst (Fortitude/2). Your wick can also be used as a Flint-Fire Kit of rank (Fortitude/2, round down). This cannot be used if you are Soaked.

### Bomb

**Range**: Burst 1  
**Damage**: Up to (Hearts), see below  
**Effect**: Choose how much damage you wish to deal, up to (Hearts). All creatures within range (even allies and yourself) take this damage; this damage never triggers your Vulnerability. This ability ignores Defense, but can be reduced by Resistance and be reacted to as appropriate. You can use this while Prone or Helpless, but cannot use this while Soaked or underwater.  
You are immune to any status effects directly applied when using Bomb or any of its options, but not to any environmental changes unless otherwise stated.  
If a To-Hit roll is called for when using the Bomb ability, add +3 to your Accuracy.  
If Health is called for as a cost (as opposed to damage), then Spend the Health unless otherwise stated.

Below is a chart with the basic Bomb ability, and other options. You can gain a specific option if you use the Bomb Typing feat to gain it. You can use any attained upgrades any time you can use the Bomb ability, though you can only use one option at a time.

### Master Mode Injuries

If you are using the Injury master mode, a Smithing check is used on a Bob-omb instead of a Nature check to help remove Injuries.

## Description

 Self-evident in their design, Bob-ombs have come into being with one purpose: destruction. These mechanical munitions are at the forefront of many conquering armies, blasting holes in fortifications and soldiers alike. Because of this, Bob-ombs have attained a reputation as being merciless, dumb, short-lived, and suicidal.

Despite their uniform exterior, within every Bob-omb is a unique mind, and through the efforts of these minds they have begun to stray from their original purpose. Bob-ombs rebelled against their masters, fled, and formed friendships with other people and, most of all, each other. In time they have learned to create, and to work in non-destructive ways. These mechanical marvels have become fighters for freedom, makers of art and buildings and philosophies. This new breed of Bomb-omb has slowly chipped away at that negative stereotype, replacing it with a more positive image consisting of discipline, self-sacrifice, a bombastic attitude, and a tendency for building useful mechanisms the world over.

Long after the bloody past, Bob-ombs are just like any other person wherever they live, despite their mechanical and explosive nature. They love, they feud, they mourn and most would not have it any other way.

Heroic Bob-ombs are often driven by a single purpose, be it exploration, the delivery of a package, or a promise to a loved one now departed. A few are even inspired to seek out the true origin of the Bob-omb, as none have knowledge of when or where they were “born”. Many scholars speculate that they are created in factories controlled by the tyrants that use them as disposable pawns, but no one has provided any proof one way or another. Others still search for other mechanical races, to better understand the world from a seemingly kindred spirit.

## Physiology

Though the stereotype of a Bob-omb is that of a walking black or red bomb with two legs, a key, a fuse and no arms, the truth is that there is plenty of differentiation within a single model, not to mention the various other models.

In reality, many, but not all, Bob-ombs have hands that are hidden in compartments when they are not in use. Even if a Bob-omb does not have hands, they are still capable of manipulating objects as if they did.

Other Bob-ombs have taken a vow of pacifism and have caps on their head instead of a fuse. Yet others lack keys, leading to scholarly speculation that wind-up Bob-ombs are made in the same place as Mechakoopas, and thus aren’t people at all.

As mechanical beings, Bob-ombs have a wider palate than their fleshy compatriots, often adding metal shavings and oil to their meals.

## A Menagerie of Munitions

Some Bob-ombs are different in size from the “standard”, known as microbombs, mezzobombs, and bob-ulks.

There’s even the King Bob-omb, a unique and gargantuan specimen. His past is shrouded in mystery, but it’s well-known that he commands a massive, multiracial army from his perch on a massive, spiral mountain, well-defended with cannons and savage Chain Chomps.

Neji Bombs are Bob-ombs with a digital face, no fuse, different legs, and a key located at the top of their head. They are generally thought of as smarter than the average Bob-omb, at least with certain advanced technology.

Chuck-Yas are a unique, mass-produced version of Bob-ombs, trading in two legs for a metal point, and with improved upper body strength and an antenna. These generally do not attack by exploding, but rather by picking up and tossing friends and foes alike.

With hard-fought freedom and the luxuries that come with civilization, many Bob-ombs have taken to changing themselves to fit the world around them – or to better find their own true self or reflect their profession. A few have been seen attempting to get bodies that match the people around them, be they human, Hylian, Goron, Toad, and the like.

## Playing a Bob-omb

Bob-ombs often have a one-track mind, typically finding it difficult to stop part-way and change direction. While this single-minded focus might be annoying to some, it can also help a Bob-omb bash through a tough problem like it was a poorly-constructed stone wall.

Bob-ombs are often selfless – or perhaps more accurately, fool-hardy – interposing themselves between enemies and themselves, and rely upon their sheer metallic bulk and explosions to ensure no one else gets hurt.

**Characteristics**: Bombastic, Brave, Foolish, Single-minded, Loyal

**Bob-omb names** usually start with B, or have hyphens or include the syllable “Bo”. The most common name among both sexes is just Bob-omb. Occasionally, they may take names from other cultures.

**Female names**: Bobolink, Bob-omb, Bob-omba, Bombette, Sylvia

**Male names**: Bobbery, Bob-omb, Bomberto, Bruce, Goldbob, Fred, Nob, Pa-Patch, Rob, White

## New Rules

### New Feat: Bob-Omb Upgrade

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Fortitude 6, Bob-omb  
**Effect**: Select a benefit of being a Bob-omb race that you do not have already. You gain that benefit. This feat can be taken multiple times.

### New Feat: Bomb Typing

*3 tokens*  
**Effect**: Select an upgrade for your Bomb ability. You can now use it.  
**Special**: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you take this, you can choose a different upgrade.

### New Feat: Bomb-chu Upgrade

*9 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Bob-omb  
**Effect**: You no longer need a weapon to Charge, and can use the Bomb ability after a Charge instead of Basic Attack. In addition, you become a Natural Climber.  
**Special**: If you have the Natural Movement (Climb) feat, your tokens for that feat are immediately refunded.

### New Feat: Crafting Style: Bob-omb

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Smithing 6  
**Effect**: You can choose to use this whenever crafting a weapon. The weapon costs 2 more materials, and is now considered Explosive.

### New Weapon Property: Explosive

This weapon can be used as a bomb that deals [(rank x2) + 1] damage. If the weapon detonates, the weapon takes 1 durability and is considered to have been used (regardless of whether someone was hurt or not). The fuse can be put out with a Water-element attack or if it is Soaked, and the weapon detonates earlier if it is hit with any Fire or Electric attack, or another bomb’s explosion. Any other attacks that target the weapon is treated as if attacking a weapon, not a bomb.

### New Feat: Fireproof Bomb Upgrade

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Bob-omb  
**Effect**: Your Vulnerability becomes Water and you gain 4 ranks of Heatwave Resistance.

### New Feat: Water Bomb Upgrade

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Bob-omb  
**Effect**: You can use your Wick Lantern bonus while Soaked, and no longer Corrode from being underwater. You can also use your Bomb ability while Soaked or underwater. Note that not all Bomb upgrades are effective underwater. For instance, the Sand-Covered and the Stained status effects will wash away the moment they are applied if the target is underwater.  
**Special**: If you have both this feat and Fireproof Bomb Upgrade, your Vulnerability becomes Shock.

### New Technique: Companion Chucker

*3 tokens*  
**Learn requirement**: Bob-omb  
**Cost**: 4 Stamina  
**Use requirement**: adjacent ally  
**Range**: Projectile 8  
**Damage**: Combat  
**Effect**: You grab and throw an ally at a target. Damage from this attack ignores Defense. Your ally does not take damage from this technique, unless the enemy deals damage upon contact. Your ally lands next to the target.

### New Technique: Firework

*6 tokens*   
**Learn requirement**: Bob-omb  
**Cost**: Up to (Athletics) Stamina  
**Use requirement**: Capable of using your Bomb ability, not underwater  
**Effect**: You send yourself flying in a straight line, using Stamina spent on this technique rather than your regular Movement (this can allow you to exceed your movement); once your turn ends, you fall as normal. You use your Bomb ability at the end of this movement.

### New Technique: Manufacture Ammunition, Lesser

*3 tokens*  
**Learn requirement**: Armos or Bob-omb  
**Cost**: 1 Magic or Stamina (Burn)  
**Use Requirement**: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory.  
**Range**: Self  
**Effect**: Select either an Arrow or a Bomb. When you use this technique, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. This may only create normal Bombs and Arrows. Ammunition made with this technique cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest.

### New Technique: Manufacture Bomb, Greater

*6 tokens*  
**Learn requirement**: Armos or Bob-omb  
**Cost**: 2 Magic or Stamina (Burn)  
**Use Requirement**: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory.  
**Range**: Self  
**Effect**: Select either a type of Arrow or a type of Bomb, worth no more than 50 Rupees. When you use this technique, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. Ammunition made with this spell cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest.

### New Technique: Reactive Bomb

*3 tokens*  
**Learn requirement**: Bob-omb  
**Cost**: 4 Stamina  
**Use requirement**: take Fire damage  
*Reaction*  
**Effect**: You use the Bomb ability, except your damage is equal to the Fire damage you have taken from the attack that triggered this reaction; a Bomb option that does not deal damage still does not deal damage. However, you do not take any damage from that use of Bomb. You can use this reaction even while Helpless and then die beyond the ability of a Small Fairy to recover.

### New Technique: Torpedo

*3 tokens*  
**Learn requirement**: Bob-omb, Water Bomb Upgrade  
**Cost**: Up to (Athletics) Stamina  
**Use requirement**: Swimming  
**Effect**: When using this ability, you can send yourself swimming in a straight line, using your Stamina spent rather than your movement (this can allow you to exceed your movement); you can also jump out of the water as part of this technique.  
You use your Bomb ability at the end of this movement.

### New Status Effect: Corroded

When a creature becomes Corroded, the creature’s Evasion is reduced by 3 and becomes Slowed.  
After a metal creature (such a Bob-omb) is damaged in combat when in freshwater, roll 2d6+(Fortitude/2)+Waterborne ranks. On a roll of 10 or less, the creature becomes Corroded.  
When in saltwater, metal creatures become Corroded after combat.  
If a creature wears metal armor, the creature becomes Slowed, and their Evasion is reduced by 1 per piece of armor that is Corroded.  
When a creature wearing metal armor is damaged in combat when in freshwater, roll 2d6+armor rank+Waterborne ranks for each piece of metal armor. On a roll of 10 or less, the piece of armor becomes Corroded.  
Waterborne rank 5 provides immunity to the Corroded status.  
The Corroded status can be removed in the same manner as the Rusted status.
