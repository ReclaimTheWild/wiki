## Description

Cor-ons are people of sea - literally. They are known for their strange biology that coral can grow on, as well as their beautiful coral homes found under the sea.

They come in great variety of colors and patterns, some are even florescent. Their color comes from coral that naturally grows on their skin and back. While most Cor-ons are pastel shades, particularly healthy Cor-ons are vibrant colors while the unhealthy fade to grays and whites.

They are shorter and lighter in weight than their mountain brethren. They are still recognizable by their potbellies and chestnut-shaped heads. Cor-ons do not have hair, per se, but they develop colorful outcroppings of coral on their chin, brow, back, and scalp as they enter adulthood. These outcroppings are typically, but not always, the same color as the corals that sprout from their back.

## Playing a Cor-on

Cor-on typically like to "go with the flow" and this mentality sometimes leads them far from the sea and potentially into trouble. While cor-ons are often alright with the way things are, cor-on heroes have usually made the decision that change is required, and they will be the ones to do it. Like their goron cousins, once they have made up their mind to do something, they prove very difficult to stop. Most cor-on lack skills in cooking, as they can get their nutrients from the water and their underwater homes don't allow for fire. However, they can eat and every dish is like a brand new experience for them on the surface world. Those that enjoy too much of surface world food may quickly find themselves overweight.

**Characteristics**: Easygoing, Kind, Oblivious, Obstinate, Strong, Tolerant

**Cor-on Names** often include the hard “Co” sound, and might reference the ocean, coral, fish, or minerals.
