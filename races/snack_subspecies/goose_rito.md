## Description

These Rito are much shorter than their more common cousin and are far less colorful. Their beaks don't come to a sharp point as other Rito, and their colors are usually white or brown with a highlight of color around their eyes and finger tips. While most Rito do enjoy being better than others, these Goose Rito take it to the extreme. To rub it in, to bully, and to trick, are the lifestyle of the Goose Rito. These seemingly acts give them great pleasure. However, despite how they may act, these actions do not necessarily mean they do not like you. They do these things to friends and enemies alike, and seem to not mind receiving similar treatment in return. The difference become more clear when it comes to foes. While a friend of a Goose Rito may find their lantern missing, a Goose Rito's foe may find their home in flames. 

## Playing a Goose Rito

Goose Rito are perhaps the opposite of diplomatic. When it comes to conversation, insults or challenges are to be expected. The goose Rito respect skill above all else just as other rito do, but their goal in their insults is usually so others can strive to be better. A Goose Rito hero is likely to consider other hero's as rivals, hoping to compete with them so both can grow to be better and more skilled. Tricking an ally now, will make them more wary to foes who would do the same or worse later. While they love to criticize, the criticism is often constructive. When it comes to combat, they prefer to put foes at a disadvantage before the fight even begins. To take a foes weapon, and smile as they reach for it, gives them no greater joy. Its common for the Goose Ritos to be agile and very rare to see them in heavier armors.

**Characteristics**: Aggressive, Confident, Instructor, Proud, Skillful, Sadistic, Tricky

**Goose Rito names** are quite varied. They usually name younglings after someone they like(regardless of race) or someone of historical importance, "stealing" the name.
