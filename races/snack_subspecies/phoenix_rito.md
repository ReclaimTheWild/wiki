## Description

These Rito are adapted to the fierce conditions near active volcanos. While their colorations are often more muted than their cold region cousins, they often dye patterns into their feathers. These dyed patterns vary greatly but often depict fire, the sun, or dragons. Fire is inherit to their nature. When a Phoenix Rito its stressed or putting forth a great deal of effort, you can see the air around them shimmer with heat. They are known to stave off death though sheer force of will, gaining them the name Phoenix Rito. To the Phoenix rito's dismay, other races often refer to them as Phritos. The Phoenix ritos are often skilled blacksmiths or stoneworkers, building their communities into a mountain side and are often neighbors to gorons. 

## Playing a Phrito

While the Phrito love a good challenge, they are less haughty and boastful. If you were to defeat one in a contest, you would likely see them boast on your behalf. They have a great passion in all that they do and fight with a fearlessly. Phrito prefer melee combat, but if things seem to be going poorly, setting a foe ablaze and putting in some distance is a common strategy.
