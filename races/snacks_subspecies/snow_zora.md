## Description

The Snowra are the zora people of the colder regions. They are less traveled than their ocean and river cousins, preferring to stick to areas of ice and snow. Because of their dark and light colorations they can be mistaken for Pengators at a distance, sometimes scaring off travelers they may encounter. While they are excellent swimmers, they are unable to breath water as other Zora do. Their homes are usually built of snow and ice on the land near ice cold waters, and sometimes into the sides of icebergs. 

## Playing a Snowra

It is rare for Snowra to leave cold regions but not unheard of. When one leaves the cold of their homeland, it is always because of a great passion or purpose. Those that leave are often heroes, diplomats, or those determined to live out a dream or change the world. Due to them often being isolated, they are sometimes awkward or unskilled at communicating with other races, occasionally asking or saying things they shouldn't. Snowra that face combat outside of their icy homeland favor the use of items to give them an advantage. Its not uncommon to see Snowra with some bottles of oil, caltrops, and elemental bombs(usually aqua or ice bombs). 

**Characteristics**: Awkward, Determined, Graceful, Passionate, Self-reliant

**Snowra Names** tend to be based on ice and snow. Their names have no bias for gender, being used for males and females about equally.

**Names**: Alaska, Celsius, Chilled, Crystal, Cole, Cooler, Elsa, Frost, Frostine, Glacius, Kelvin.
