## Description

The Mire Zora live in regions where most would refuse to even enter, making territory disputes rare. Areas of swamp, poison and blight are areas these Zora take to like fish into water. Their skin colors vary greatly, and resemble the colorations of poison dart frogs. Family members typically have a similar pattern, but can have a great deal of difference in coloration. Unlike the beautiful homes of their river and ocean cousins, their homes are often very simple. Their buildings are usually wooden and built on stilts, so they are above the swampy mud. They enjoy a variety of foods that other races would not even consider touching. Monster parts are often incorporated into meals, and often pickled. These pickled monster parts, along with durians, and other pungent foods, are considered delicacies and have a high trade value to the Mire Zora. They share a great deal of hospitality to those who would visit and love to cook for guests and entertain. They know other races aren't as culinarily inclined and substitute the monster parts they enjoy for some less intense flavors when cooking for other races. 

## Playing a Mire Zora

Mire Zora heroes are often very passionate. When it comes to fighting off the evils of the land, they consider it their gift to the world, and they are generous in giving this gift. They are also very friendly and trusting, often giving a second chance where maybe one wouldn't be deserved. When dealing with others they are very polite but often very direct. It would be rare for them to go a full sentence without a please or thank you, but have no qualms with pointing out someone's flaws. When it comes to combat, they prefer to be mobile, often fighting at a distance. Those Mire Zora who prefer close combat, favor striking and moving to block a foes escape.
