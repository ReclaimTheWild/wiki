## Description

Ore-ons are live deep underground and consume a diet far higher in metals than their mountain brethren. Their cities often make use of naturally magnetic materials or electromagnets to create pathways. While the Ore-ons traverse these paths without issue, even ones going upside down, other races find navigating their cities difficult.

Ore-on come in great variety metallic colors. Their skin has a natural luster to it, and those who take painstaking care of their skin can achieve a highly reflective finish. Ore-ons do not have hair, per se, but they develop outcroppings of metal on their chin, brow, back, and scalp as they enter adulthood. These outcroppings are usually silver or bronze, and tarnish with age. In some rare cases the the outcroppings are gold in color.

They are taller and heavier in weight than their mountain brethren. They are still recognizable by their potbellies and chestnut-shaped heads.

Traveling Ore-on often need to be wary of their weight. The construction and furniture in non-goron cities often struggle with the weight of a normal Goron. So recognizing which furnishings are safe to sit on is important away from home. 

## Playing a Ore-on

Ore-ons quickly become more alert as they travel. It only takes a few broken chairs or getting stuck in the mud to learn this important lesson. The Ore-ons are slow to start like other gorons, but they are quite enthusiastic and difficult to deter once their mind is made up. They are usually very kind, wanting to help everyone. They may often get caught up biting off more than they can chew. Ore-on prefer not to get into fights when possible, if they are in a fight, it might be because they want to help or protect someone else over themselves.
