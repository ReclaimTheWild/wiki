## Overview

Average Height: 5’ – 6′ 3″ (humanoid form), 2’ – 4’ (ache form)  
Average Weight: 115 – 140 lbs. (humanoid form), < 2 lbs (ache form)

**Play an Acheman if you want…**
* … to work alongside your fellow monsters to conquer Hyrule.
* … to find your place in the world, free of conflict and prejudice.
* … to right your ancestor’s wrongs.
* … to use the darkness against all who oppose you.

**Weakness**: Light  
**Bonuses**:
* You can echolocate. As long as you can hear, you ignore any penalties involving visibility (including pure darkness, invisibility, and the blind condition). In addition, you also roll twice and use the better result when using Perception to find creatures through sound. This ability doesn’t negate the effects of cover or other barriers that provide a physical (not just visual) impediment to your attacks.
* You may speak with, and understand, creatures of Limited Intelligence that serve or are controlled by a great evil. This does not mean they automatically want to speak with you, or that they will tell you the truth.
* As a minor action, you can transform into (or from) your Ache form, which is Small. In your Ache form, you cannot use weapons, but you have natural flight and natural gliding, and can hang upside down from ceilings without issue. You also roll twice and use the better result when using Agility trait rolls.
* In your humanoid form, you have unnatural flight and unnatural gliding.

## Description

When they hear the word “vampire”, Hylians typically think of the Achemen. These monstrous bat-people have served the Calamity for millennia, terrorizing the people of Hyrule in the night.

Standing as tall as the average Hylian, Achemen have the monstrous visage of a bat shaped into a man, with long, lanky limbs and short wings. They are covered in a light layer of fur, except on their limbs, and sport two large fangs. They have beady little eyes, ill-suited for the darkness they tend to dwell in.

Achemen tend to dwell in caves, occasionally with their fellow monsters, though many venture out and infiltrate the societies of other races in disguise. Strangely, however, despite their ache form’s similarity to Keese, their caves almost never contain actual Keese.

Most Achemen prefer the taste of blood, especially from unwilling and struggling citizens of Hyrule. When they can’t get their favorite meal, though, they may settle for any wild (or domesticated) creature they can get their claws on. The more considerate and discreet Achemen mainly eat fruits and insects to gain their sustenance, though if a willing person were to offer their own blood…

## History

Acheman begin their lives as simple Ache, monstrous bats not unlike Keese, though somewhat larger. During their formative years they are taken care of by their mothers, and occasionally fathers, until they learn to speak, fly, and perform dark magic. Usually, Ache society can expect an Ache to fly two paths: one in which they learn to disguise themselves as a mortal and live in mortal societies, while others instead learn the magic to become an Acheman.

Few know the true origin of the Achemen, though most sages believe they were created from Keese when the Dark Lord saw the devastation that Hyrule’s Loftwing Cavalry rained upon his forces. An ancient book found in the small, riverside hamlet of Nabooru Town contains an interview with a rare, friendly Acheman. This book reports that the Acheman race passes down the legend that they were the ones who inspired the Dark Lord to bring Hyrule into eternal night.

Whatever the truth of the matter, the Achemen have lived in Hyrule, be it in caves among their own, or in disguise among the populace they wish to enslave. They plot for the return of the Calamity, when they aren’t actively serving underneath it. As a whole, Acheman colonies are generally anarchic, formed of kin groups usually centered around the eldest female relative. However, intermingling is common, and oftentimes a group of Achemen fly off to establish their own colonies, go exploring, or check to see if the Dark Lord has returned.

While kin groups are often named after a matriarch, the biggest divisions in Achemen society are in their philosophy.

* The Infiltrators prefer living in mortal societies in disguise, so that they can better understand their prey and to sabotage attempts to fight back against them. Their spycraft most often leads to paranoia among Hylians and Sheikah, and in turn leads to trouble for the Achemen who have abandoned their common cause and try to live among other races.
* The Predators live in caves and come out to openly attack mortals during the night, or otherwise actively serve the great evil’s army by scouting, coordinating, and commanding.
* The Inventors are the smallest group that serve evil, opting instead to develop new weapons and other methods of defeating their foes. However, the danger they and their inventions present to both mortals and to their fellows (and superiors within the dark forces) means they are the most feared, and thus are often not welcome among Predators, Infiltrators, or factions less involved with matters of conquest and evil.
* Neutrals tend to stay out of contact with non-Achemen, unless they are out feeding. They are typically the least known about, because Achemen with this philosophy tend to interact least with Hyrule’s populace.

In time, however, a few Achemen have grown tired of the constant cycle of conflict and devastation, and have left their home colonies for a change of culture. These few Exiles, or Vagabonds, contain a seed of goodness within them, that sometimes sprouts and encourages them to help improve the world where many of their fellows only destroy. Often, though, they will be shunned, and even attacked, unless – and sometimes even despite – showing their better nature. Most rogue Achemen simply live their lives in solitude, or disguised as a Keese, though a rare few put on a magical disguise and live among others.

## Playing an Acheman

Acheman tend to place a heavy emphasis on the greater causes, be it serving the Dark Lord or following their own path. Often, without a great cause to dedicate themselves to, an Acheman tends to simply worry about their own survival and little else. When they’re withdrawn, an Acheman may have trouble attaching themselves to a new cause, but if they do, they can become a passionate believer.

Acheman work best whenever they have their enemy at a disadvantage, such at night or in dark environments like caves. As such, they often prefer using stealth, hit and run tactics, deception and their flight to take advantage of their environment.

When not in a better situation than their enemy, Achemen tend to be more cautious… and will attempt to flip the situation in their favor, or at least try to talk their way out of any confrontation. If nothing else works, then a simple retreat to fight another day is usually called for.

**Characteristics**: Sadistic, Clever, Vengeful, Proactive
