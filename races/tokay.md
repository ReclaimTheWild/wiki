**Play a Tokay if you wantâ€¦**
* ...To play an exotic, uniquely-minded character.
* ...To provide a different perspective on Hyrulean traditions.
* ...To be adept at getting the best deals.
* ...To be the odd one out in the group, toka.

**Vulnerability**: Ice  
**Bonuses**:
* You are a Natural Swimmer. Furthermore, you can hold your breath for twice as long as normal.
* Treat Heatwave Weather as two ranks lower when calculating its effects (minimum 0). In addition, you ignore the effects of Foaming water.
* You have a Knack for Active Haggling.
* You have naturally sharp claws. You have a single Rank 1 Fist weapon, in the Tokay style (4 Accuracy, 4 Attack, 5 Durability, no penalty while swimming). You may treat any empty hand as holding this natural weapon. Much like a Weapon Spirit, it recovers 2 Durability every Extended Rest; when reduced to 0 Durability, it merely becomes unusable, instead of breaking. Also like a Weapon Spirit, your natural weapon may be improved to a Rank of up to ((Discipline + Fortitude) / 3), by using Monster Parts of the same Rank. Like any weapon, your natural weapon may be Enchanted.

*(Work in Progress)*

**Characteristics**: Naive, Curious, Unfamiliar, Inquiring, Chipper, Perceptive, Sly

**Tokay Names** are simple, usually with one or two syllables, although three syllables are also possible. In many cases, the names are based on valuable gemstones, to pronounce how much Tokay cherish their children and would never trade them away. Given the race's focus on a barter economy, that is a strong declaration of parental love and pride.

**Male Names**: Agat, Akuam, Diam, Emer, Lazu, Malach, Jasp, Paz, Rald, Spi, Top, Turk

**Female Names**: Amba, Ame, Lapi, Onny, Opa, Mondi, Phira, Pyri, Rubi, Sappy, Sidi, Xandri
