## Description

Nopons are small, furry beings that, naturally, inhabit villages in forests, although it is not unusual to see them everywhere else. At first, these balls of fluff might seem intellectually undeveloped, ignoring many elements and constructions in their sentences when speaking. However, they are by no means not smart; in fact, they are cunning and persuasive.

Nopons are small and have fur all over their bodies, except in the belly area. They are somewhat round, although many people have referred to them as "talking potatoes". Nopons have six limbs: four thin ones that serve as legs and arms, with their respective little paws, and two bigger ones that resemble some kind of wings growing out from just below the back of their necks, which they use to carry most things thanks to their hand-like ends. All of these physical characteristics allow them to hide with ease, flee from predators in many ways, and even flutter a bit with their wings.

Nopons live throughout the whole world. Not even a volcano is a place tough enough for a Nopon if living there means making profit. Even so, their preferred and natural environment are forests, where they form great communities and build their structures, always respecting the natural environment. If you suddenly find yourself within Nopon territory, fear not, a charming welcoming is coming your way.

Their ways might be different from those of other intelligent species, but that's because all of their needs are always covered in their communities, so Nopon merely develop their societies using what they have at their disposal, rarely creating great, mechanical inventions. 

## Playing a Nopon

Nopons are simple-minded, but they are also greedy and selfish when it comes to business. They enjoy living with other people and respect social order, however. These attitudes combined drive Nopons towards a very specific profession in life: commerce. The great majority of Nopon are interested in making money for themselves or their families, but there are lots who would prefer to take on other needed professions, becoming doctors, chefs or teachers.

All Nopons see a friend in every intelligent race, and will express that friendship at any moment, calling whatever person whose name they do not know yet "friend". They are also respectful for foreign traditions and cultures, as well as wallets. If you do something for a Nopon, you will get something in exchange, although it typically won't be worth the effort and you'll just get scammed. All and all, whatever a Nopon is doing, they will always think that it helps for the greater good, whether that's actually true or not.

Nopons are also known for their empathy towards animals, being able to understand their body language and communicate back. With this great ability, Nopons make up for what they lack by taming creatures that can help them.

Their simple minds are also a key factor of their personae; they sometimes won't appreciate the true worth of something, and other times they will over-value it. For this reason, if a Nopon is giving you a heartfelt gift, accept it no matter what it is, your Nopon friend might think of it as something of great, great value when it actually is worth nothing in your society.

Nopon heroes will often prefer carrying a light weight over wielding great equipment. This way, when it's time to high-tail it out of battle, they can be the first ones to be out of harm's way. Some might be brave enough to defy the odds and take on the danger head-on, in hopes of succeeding and creating their own legend within their poor, defenseless Nopon folk back home. In the end, all a Nopon wants is success.

## Nopons, language and family

Nopons express themselves verbally in a unique way. While they speak the language spoken in the land they live in, they find it quite difficult to properly follow all the rules of a given language. As such, Nopons continuously omit elements such as prepositions, use the different forms of personal pronouns incorrectly, use the infinitive form of a verb for most situations, and sometimes even turn the order of the words upside-down. This way of speaking is deeply established in Nopon settlements, making them believe that when someone speaks "correctly", that someone is actually speaking in a strange, unique way. This language barrier does not hinder communication with a Nopon, however; in the end, both you and your furry friend are speaking the same language.

When it comes to naming things, Nopons don't bother making complicated names. The name of a given thing might simply be a word or two that describe the way they think about it, or even adding a cool-sounding (at least for them) adjective after a more general noun. Other time, however, they might simply say "pon" after the widespread name of the item in question.

"Pon" is a signature word of their language. The closest thing to it in other hyrulean cultures is the "Goro" from Gorons. "Pon" on itself bears no meaning, it can be used in a variety of ways; a Nopon might express joy by screaming "Pon!", or might call a Hylian a "Hylia pon". "Pon" is also used to refer to family relatives: mamapon, papapon, unclepon, minipon for children, littlepon for one's children, etc.. Lastly, to refer to themselves, Nopons will, most of the time, use their names instead of pronouns, maybe in an attempt of reinforcing their presence and importance.
