## Overview

Average Height: 5' - 8'  
Average Weight: 19 - 45 lbs  
Life Span: None, as they are already dead.  
Eye Color: Red, Orange, Blue, or Green glowing eyes.  
Stalfos have no hair nor skin.  

**Play as a Stal-fold if you wantâ€¦**
* ...to see the world of Hyrule from ancient eyes.
* ...to restore the natural cycle of life and death.
* ...to take advantage of your skeletal nature to confound foes.
* ...to embrace the peace and dignity of death...or just make a bunch of skeleton jokes.

**Vulnerability**: Light
**Bonuses**:
* You cannot eat food and gain no benefit from Food or Dishes. However, you may still benefit from Elixirs and Magic, and may consume Monster Parts to regain Health equal to twice the Part's Rank.
* You have no need to breathe, and cannot drown or suffocate.
* Being a creature adapted to darkness, you see in the dark as though it were light. In addition, you treat Blindness as though you were a Boss.
* You may speak with, and understand, Undead creatures of Limited intelligence (like gibdos, poes, and stalfos). This does not mean they automatically want to speak with you, or that they will tell you the truth.
* Select a Combat Maneuver from the following: Hobble, Low Blow, Sand Attack. As an action, and at the cost of 3 Stamina, you may detach one of your arms. This arm may be thrown (as a 1-H weapon), or it may move on its own on your turn. Anything the arm was holding at the time of detachment is Unequipped, but not lost. An arm moving on its own counts as permanently Slowed. When detached from its owner, your arm may perform the selected Combat Maneuver, using the Stalfos' stats. The arm counts as Hard to Hit, and if struck by any damaging attack it falls limp and may not be re-attached or act again until a short rest is taken.

## Description

Those familiar with Ganon's occasional attacks on the land of Hyrule are aware of the prevalence of undead within the ranks of his army of evil. From the sneaky poes, to the dreaded redead, to the fearsome stalfos, the appearance of undead is a sure sign that Ganon or another great evil is gaining power. The presence of dark magic drags those long since deceased back to rotten corpses, and twists tortured souls into willing servants of evil.

Few, however, are aware that not all undead are under evil's thrall. Due to uncommonly strong ties to the mortal world, whether a vital mission incomplete or a powerful force of love unfulfilled, some lost souls awaken and retain their minds despite the advanced decay of their physical bodies. Known as Stal-folk, these ambulatory skeletons often band together for mutual support. When possible, Stal-folk tribes form friendly ties with nearby communities of the "live ones", though it must be said that fear of undead runs so deep among most villages that Stal-folk delegations are more often met by screams and drawn bows. Still, Stal-folk are not evil by nature and are capable of recognizing the inherent difficulties that come with such tasks.

At first glance, Stal-folk appear little different from their fiercer Stalfos cousins. Both are the skeletons of former Hylians, Gerudo, or Sheikah, and they have the same variety in heights and builds. Those familiar with both varieties of undead can point out that Stal-folk tend to have a more relaxed posture; and their faces, despite being made of the same bone, have an oddly friendly softness to them in contrast to the harsh lines of Stalfos. Stal-folk wear clothing not too dissimilar to what they wore in life, whether that be peasant garb or a prince's gilded armor, though social stratification is a virtually unknown concept in Stal-folk tribes. Death, after all, has made equals of them all.

As they are not technically alive, Stal-folk can exist for a very long time indeed. If they do not meet a violent end, an individual Stalperson can go on for centuries; wandering the land, honing their skills, and experiencing things few mortal creatures ever can. The secret goal in every Stalperson's heart is to finally achieve the goal that brought them back from the grave, so that they may finally rest in peace.
