### **Silvered**
- **Uses**: Diamond
- **Equipment Type**: Any Weapon
- **Effect**: Foes who are considered a great evil, or are serving or controlled by a great evil, have a Weakness to this weapon. This weapon may also trigger a Boss or Miniboss’s Weak Point, though that varies from foe to foe. (These effects only occur if the foe is of a Rank equal to or less than this Enchantment’s Rank; otherwise, this Enchantment does nothing.)
