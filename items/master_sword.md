*The Hero’s triumph on Cataclysm’s Eve*

*The Master Sword he will then retrieve,*  
*Keeping the Knight’s line true.*

*Reclaim the Wild* intends for players to play all-new Heroes, rather than rehashing Link and his adventures. However, the time might come when you want to have the Master Sword show up in your game. Perhaps Link himself makes an appearance, and needs your Heroes’ help to accomplish a task and save the day. Alternatively, perhaps Link died, or was never born – and hitherto-unknown Heroes must now take up the Master Sword and do what needs be done.

Famously, the Master Sword is rarely the most powerful sword Link wields. Sometimes it’s rusted, a shadow of its former glory; sometimes it’s blessed by a Great Fairy or even a Goddess, imbued with incredible power. As such, we present the Master Sword in a variety of states, below.

## Weapons

(In the statblocks below, the effects of Enchantments on the weapons’ Accuracy, Attack, and Durability are already taken into account.)

### Master Sword (*Neglected*)

{: .fs-6 }

**Rank 5 Sword, Goddess-Forged Style**

## Enchantment & Crafting-Style

The above Master Sword writeups use both a custom Crafting Style, and a custom Enchantment. Those are presented below! (And of course, you may use them separate from the Master Sword(s) above, if you so choose.)

### Silvered
**Uses**: Diamond  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: Foes who are considered a great evil, or are serving or controlled by a great evil, have a Weakness to this weapon. This weapon may also trigger a Boss or Miniboss’s Weak Point, though that varies from foe to foe. (These effects only occur if the foe is of a Rank equal to or less than this Enchantment’s Rank; otherwise, this Enchantment does nothing.)

### Crafting Style: Goddess-Forged
*9 Tokens*  
**Trait Requirement**: Smithing 9  
**Effect**: You may choose to use this whenever crafting a weapon in a place of deep magical power (such as in a temple, or in the Sacred Realm). The weapon costs 5 more Materials, cannot be set Burning or Rusted, will only take Durability damage from normal use, and has 2 greater Durability and 2 greater Accuracy.

*When you drew that sword of yours out of its pedestal…*  
*Did you understand precisely what that means?*  
*…I highly doubt you do.*
