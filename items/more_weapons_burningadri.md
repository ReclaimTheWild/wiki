**Note 1, Helmets**: Helmet weapons can be either Blunt, Piercing, or Sharp, determined when the item is first made.

**Note 2, Bladebows**: Bladebows are usually Piercing weapons (when you fire an Arrow from them). Some arrow types may alter this. If a Bladebow is thrown, it is Sharp. A Bladebow can be used for both Melee and Ranged Basic Attacks. When attacking with one, you might need to specify which kind of attack will be used.

## What are these?

This new set of weapons exist to suit those who want to play certain styles of characters that, sadly, are not reflected in *Reclaim the Wild*'s Core Rulebook, or even further expand on other styles.

**Helmet** weapons are specialized head gear that will let you headbutt your way to victory, and they don't replace your Head Armor for that! If your group has a Goron that only trusts his fists and feet, tell them that you can also use your head to win a battle!

**Tonfas** are cane-like weapons wielded by putting them attached to your arms, grabbing them by a little spot that allows so. They are sturdy weapons, known for being the cause of many broken bones.

**Nunchaku** consist of two little, cane-like, sturdy sticks tied together by a rope or a chain. They are useful tools that can be used in a wide variety of scenarios, and little kids like to mess with them, moving them around like crazy and eventually hitting their own faces. Be wary!

A **Flying Sword** is, well, a sword that flies! These magically-enhanced weapons are tied to their user, who controls them with brain work and hand commands, like an orchestra conductor with an invisible baton commanding a sharp band. While you may think that a Flying Sword is befitting of the Hands-Free Keyword, truth is, it takes a big amount of focus for the "conductor" to maintain the blade floating with their commands.

**Dual Blades** are, simply put, two short swords put together, with each edge at each side. Nothing much to be said here.

A **Bladebow** is a sort of switchblade attached to the superior part of your wrist with a crossbow wire included over it. Keeping a firm grip on it, and also a finger on the crossbow part's trigger!, is highly important at all times.

Finally, **Brushes** are what painters use to draw, but of the size of a short sword, or even a spear! These magical artifacts cast and use paint in order to canalize spells, as well as to taint the world of your color of choice!
