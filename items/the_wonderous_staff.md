# The Wonderous Staff

**Description**: This long dark gray staff is topped with a many sided gem that gently glows with continuously shifting colors.

**Effect**: Once per extended rest the Staff can be activated(the gems light becomes dull until it recharges with an extended rest). You choose a target, and roll 2d6. The first dice determines the row, and the 2nd the column, selecting the effect you produce. The effects usually name a spell or technique they duplicate with any changes listed in parenthesis. The Staff functions as a Rank 1 Staff(Acc 2, ATK 7, DUR 7, Wizardly) made of ancient materials for the cast effects, but can not be used to cast other spells or use arcane salvo. This staff can be upgraded and repaired as a spirit weapon can. At DM's discretion, the staff can be forced to activate again. The table is rolled as normal, but the amount of magic listed in brackets [] is expended(or burned, see notes) from the user. If the user has insufficient magic, the remaining is paid with hit points.

**Notes**: Costs labeled with "B", burn magic and can't be paid with temporary magic/temporary hit points. The effects that burn magic last until a short or extended rest. Costs labeled with X always use the maximum possible effect the wielder and staff are capable of. For example, a welder with 5 Willpower with a bonus of 1 from the staff would need to expend 6 magic for the Korok Leaf's wind effect.

**Other notes**: If your game contains no pokemon, substitute effects containing pokemon with a matching rank monster with limited intelligence.

**More notes**: When an effect calls for a summon, the creature appears and functions as a companion. Other creatures the staff causes to appear are neutral or hostile.
