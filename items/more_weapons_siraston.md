**Note 1, Seed Shooter**: The listed Edge type typically applies when using Techniques that do not rely on basic attacks. Under Master Mode rules, Seed Shooters use Seeds as ammunition instead of Arrows (see [Expand Your Armory]({{ "/items/expand_armory" | absolute_url }})).

**Note 2, Sheikah Switchblade**: A mysterious weapon that dates back to ancient times, the weapon is capable of folding into itself to preserve space while not in use to keep the hands unoccupied, making it ideal for Sheikah agents who expect both infiltration and heavy combat during the same mission.

**Note 3**: *Artillery* weapons consume Cannonballs instead of Arrows when using the Shoot Arrow action, ignoring the Cannonball's base damage (see Rebuild the Wild, Page 38). When attacking, add (Cannonball's Rank / 2, rounded up) to the weapon's ATK.

**Note 4**: *Lunging* weapons are made for incredible agility and quickly stepping in and out to extend one's striking range. As part of an Attack or Technique using the Lunging weapon, you may spend 1 Stamina to move 1 square and then resolve the Attack or Technique. After resolving it, you move 1 square in the opposite direction of the first move. Entering these squares costs no movement. To perform the Lunging, you must not enter difficult terrain for both the first and the second time you move 1 square by this effect.

**Note 5**: *Weighted* weapons are made for throwing, having been prepared in such a way that they can be easily accessed. Weighted Weapons have +3 ATK when thrown and immediately after an action that involved throwing Weighted weapons, you may move an item from your belt or a Weighted weapon from your pack into your empty hand(s) as a free action. Weighted Weapons are a prime candidate for adding the Throw Only keyword.

*Throw Only* weapons have been made exclusively for fire-and-forget purposes. They have half their Market value than normal for their Rank, but they only have half as much Duration and using such a weapon for anything but the Throw Weapon Basic Attack and Techniques that require a Thrown Weapon will make it take Durability damage equal to its Durability after the action has been resolved.

## New Feats

### Aerodynamics Expert
*3 Tokens*  
**Learn Requirement**: Accuracy 3  
**Effect**: Your Throw Weapon attacks with two-handed Returning weapons have +2 Projectile range.

### Hinox Pitching
*3 Tokens*  
**Learn Requirement**: Accuracy 6, Aerodynamics Expert  
**Effect**: Aerodynamics Expert now includes all two-handed weapons.

### Cannon Chemist
*3 Tokens*  
**Learn Requirement**: Mechanics 3  
**Effect**: While you have an Artillery weapon equipped, you may use Elixirs from your belt on targets by using the Shoot Arrow Basic Attack with that Elixir. This causes no damage to the target, and merely uses the Elixir on them as if they were in melee range of you. You have +3 Accuracy when using Elixirs that way (targets may always choose to get hit without rolling if they wish so, as usual)

### Elixir Grenadier
*3 Tokens*  
**Learn Requirement**: Cannon Chemist, Mechanics 6  
**Effect**: When using the Shoot Arrow Basic Attack to use an Elixir, you may replace the Elixir's usual effect with the following effects if you hit:  
- Boosted Trait: Target is Distracted by you for (Point Value / 6) turns.
- Combat Prowess: Inflict Slowed for (Point Value / 6) turns.
- Resist Damage: Inflict Cursed (Dark), Frozen (Ice), Sand-Covered (Earth), On Fire (Fire), Blinded (Light), Off-Balance (Shock) or Soaked (Water) and deal Weapon + (Point Value / 3) damage of the same Element. All listed status effects last until the end of the target's next turn, in addition to all other methods of removing these.
- Restorative: Deal Weapon + Combat + (Point Value / 3) Piercing damage.
- Temp Pool: Deal Weapon + (Point Value / 3) Piercing damage in a Burst 1 area around the target, the area includes the target.

### Crafting Modification: Throw Only
*3 Tokens*  
**Learn Requirement**: Smithing 3  
**Effect**: You may choose to use this whenever crafting a Melee weapon. The weapon costs half as many materials (after modified by Crafting Style and other Crafting Modifications), and gains the Throw Only keyword.

*More informations about Crafting Modifications available [here]({{ "/feats/crafting_modifications" | absolute_url }})*

### Trained Watchman
*3 Tokens*  
**Learn Requirement**: Agility 6  
**Effect**: You may use a Lunging weapon to Deflect, but you can only attack or Deflect with such a weapon during the same round, never both.

### Master Watchman
*6 Tokens*  
**Learn Requirement**: Graceful Duelist, Agility 9  
**Effect**: You can now attack and Deflect with a Lunging weapon during the same round. If you do so at least once during an encounter, increase the Durability damage your weapon receives at the end of combat by 1.
