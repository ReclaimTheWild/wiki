*Hyrule Warriors* and *Breath of the Wild* contained numerous new weapons, so here is an article that will provide weapons from those two games and beyond. In addition, we have new character options that allow you to use your weapons in unique new ways, plus two new Master Modes!

## New Weapons

Note 1: The Boots, Parasols, Rings, and Throwing Gloves are entries for purposefully built weapons. Not all boots, gloves, parasols, rings, and umbrellas are purposefully built to be weapons. However, they can be used as improvised weaponry as appropriate, and thus typically fall apart after one battle.

Note 2: Boots, Rings, Summoning Gates, and Throwing Gloves can be either Blunt, Piercing, or Sharp, determined when the item is first made.

Note 3: Giant Boomerangs are treated as Boomerangs for the purposes of any feats, techniques, spells, and other rules that refer to Boomerangs.

Note 4: **Ranged weapons** shoot Arrows, which usually deal Piercing damage. Some arrow types may alter this. The listed Edge type typically applies when using Techniques that do not rely on basic attacks. If Ranged weapons are Thrown, they deal Blunt damage. See below for a master mode involving different ammunition types.

Note 5: **[Quarterstaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterstaff)** may also be known as bō, among numerous other names. They are a shaft of wood, metal, or ancient material long enough to strike with the same range as a Spear, and can be used in many melee basic attacks and techniques that require melee weapons. This is in contrast to the Staff – sometimes called a Magic Staff, Focusing Staff, or Wizard’s Staff – which is an arcane weapon typically used for spellcasting, and incapable of being used to hit people in melee without the use of the *Monastic Training* feat.

Note 6: **Summoning weapons** apply their weapon style and applicable enchantments to the weapons of creatures created, conjured, or summoned through spells and techniques, such as [Zelda’s Phantom]({{ "/spells/zelda_phantom" | absolute_url }}).

## New Weapon Options

### New Feat: Arcane Archer

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Combat 3, Willpower 3  
**Effect**: Your Ranged Weapons are now also treated as Arcane Weapons while you wield them. You can use the Spell Volley basic attack and the weapons gain the Wizardly keyword. Optionally, you may expend ammunition with your Arcane Volley basic attack (1 per target) to apply their effect to those attacks.
If your Ranged weapon only gains the Wizardly keyword through feats such as this one or Spellsword, your spell damage has a -1 penalty with that Ranged weapon.

### New Feat: Chain Rope

*3 tokens*  
**Effect**: You may use Extending weapons as Rope of 1 rank lower. The length of the rope varies:

* 1H Extending weapons have a length equal to (Whipcrack’s range);
* 2H Extending weapons have a length equal to (Throw Weapon’s range).

The weapon can only take damage when used as a Rope. If the weapon’s HP becomes 0, then it loses 1 additional point of Durability and cannot be used as Rope again until after the end of battle or the scene.
If your Empty Hand (or a similar rankless weapon) [becomes an Extending weapon]{{ "/items/expand_armory/extending" | absolute_url }}, treat it as a Rope with a rank according to the following graph:

| ROPE RANK | REQUIRES FORTITUDE |
|-----------|--------------------|
| 0         | 1                  |
| 1         | 2                  |
| 2         | 5                  |
| 3         | 7                  |
| 4         | 10                 |

If your use would break a normal Rope, you cannot use your Empty Hand as a Rope until you take an Extended Rest.

### New Feat: Parasol Glide

*6 tokens*  
**Effect**: You can glide using your Parasol. If you cannot normally glide, you become an Unnatural Glider; if an Unnatural Glider without the Parasol, then you become a Natural Glider. Regardless, you Spend 2 Magic or Stamina (chosen when you take this feat) at the beginning of each of your turns. If you cannot Spend this Magic or Stamina, you let go of the Parasol and begin falling.

### New Feat: Parasol Save

*3 tokens*  
**Effect**: You can use your Parasol as a Sailcloth of 1 rank lower. Unlike an actual Sailcloth, the Parasol replaces even Hands-Free items.

### New Feat: Pole Vaulter

*3 tokens*  
**Effect**: When wielding a Long weapon, increase your Athletics (Jumping) score by (Rank / 2) if you are jumping from solid ground (as opposed to water or mid-air jumping). This does not stack if you are wielding multiple Long weapons.

### New Feat: Snapshot

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Agility 3, Combat 3  
**Effect**: Your Ranged Weapons are now also treated as Melee Weapons while you wield them. You can use Strike and Parry basic attacks with Ranged Weapons, and your 2H Ranged Weapons gain the Sweeping keyword. Optionally, you may expend ammunition with your melee basic attacks (1 per target) to apply their effect to those attacks.

### New Feat: Spellsword

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Combat 3, Willpower 3  
**Effect**: Your Melee Weapons are now also treated as Arcane Weapons while you wield them. You can use the Spell Volley basic attack and the weapons gain the Wizardly keyword.  
If your Melee weapon only gains the Wizardly keyword through feats such as this one or Arcane Archer, your spell damage has a -1 penalty with that Melee weapon.

### New Feat: Thrown Weapon Master

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Agility 3, Accuracy 3  
**Effect**: You can now use Melee weapons with techniques that require Ranged weapons.  
Melee weapons that have the Returning special quality by default (such as Boomerangs) have their Attack increased by 1.  
Your Melee weapons gain the Returning special quality.

### New Feat: Wandslinger

*6 tokens*  
**Trait requirement**: Agility 3, Combat 3  
**Effect**: You can use your Arcane weapons with techniques that require Ranged weapons.  

### New Spell: Magnesis Warrior

*6 tokens* 
**Learn requirement**: Magnesis  
**Cost**: 4 Magic (Bind)  
*Minor action*  
**Effect**: While Magic is Bound in this spell, you can use magnetic forces to wield certain weapons – typically Metal – with a few extra benefits. These weapons gain the Hands-Free and Returning qualities.  
You may also magnetically wield and use metal non-weapon items (such as lockpicks, percussion instruments, metal arrows with Ranged weapons, etc) with this spell, allowing them to float around you. However, you can only wield up to two one-handed items, or one two-handed item.

### New Technique: Mordhau

*3 tokens*  
**Cost**: 4 Stamina (Bind)  
**Range**: Self  
*Minor action*  
**Effect**: When you learn this technique, choose one of the following Edge Types: blunt, piercing, sharp. When you use this technique, your melee weapon now deals that type of damage instead of its normal Edge Type.  
**Special**: You can buy this technique multiple times. Each time, you can choose an Edge Type you do not already have. If you have multiple versions of this technique, then you can choose which Edge Type you wish to use when you enter it, and you can change it as a minor action.

## New Master Mode: Diverse Ammunition

By default, Ranged weapons use Arrows as their ammunition. This allows for simplicity in bookkeeping. However, this may cause weird mental images… After all, an adventurer loading an arrow onto a slingshot or into a handgun is silly enough… much less the adventurer just *throwing* the arrow at the enemy!

With this new master mode, each Ranged weapon is sorted into a particular category that only uses a particular type of ammunition. The different types of ammunition do not stack together.

| AMMUNITION TYPE  | WEAPONS          |
|------------------|------------------|
| Arrows           | Bow, Crossbow    |
| Bullets          | Hangun, Long Gun |
| Seeds            | Slingshot        |
| Throwing Weapons | Throwing Glove   |

The different sorts of ammunition may also come with their own takes on edge types, with different costs, as shown below.

| AMMUNITION TYPE | DAMAGE TYPE: AMMUNITION NAME                                                                                                              | COST |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Arrow           | Piercing: Arrow                                                                                                                           | 5    |
| Arrow           | Sharp: Broadhead Arrow<br>Blunt: Hammerhead Arrow                                                                                         | 10   |
| Bullet          | Piercing: Bullet                                                                                                                          | 5    |
| Bullet          | Sharp: Shredder Round<br>Blunt: Hollowpoint Bullet                                                                                        | 10   |
| Seed            | Blunt: Seed                                                                                                                               | 5    |
| Seed            | Piercing: Thorny Seed<br>Sharp: Bladed Seed                                                                                               | 10   |
| Throwing Weapon | Blunt: Throwing Hammer, Shotput, Discus, etc<br>Sharp: Shuriken, Throwing Dagger, Throwing Axe, etc<br>Piercing: Kunai, Dart, Needle, etc | 5    |

If the cost is 5 rupees, then the ammunition is made in the same way as Arrows. If the cost is 10 rupees, then ammunition is made in the same way as Broadhead Arrows.

The other ammunition types have less variation in their names. They are made the same way as their Arrow equivalents, and act the same way.

| ARROW             | BULLET             | SEED               | THROWING WEAPON             |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Bomb Arrow        | Explosive Round    | Bomb Flower Seed   | Mini-Bombs                  |
| Elemental Arrow   | Elemental Bullet   | Elemental Seed     | Elemental Throwing Weapon   |
| Showstopper Arrow | Showstopper Bullet | Grass Whistle Seed | Showstopper Throwing Weapon |
| Snag Arrow        | Snag Bullet        | Sprout Seed        | Snag Throwing Weapon        |
| Guardian Arrow    | Guardian Bullet    | Guardian Pellet    | Guardian Throwing Weapon    |
| Silver Arrow      | Silver Bullet      | Silver Pellet      | Silver Throwing Weapon      |

Special thanks to Discord community member [SirAston](https://reclaimthewild.net/wiki/index.php?title=User:SirAston) for providing names for some of the Seeds.

## New Master Mode: Natural Rings

Talking Animals – and any other homebrewed races with the Magical Armed trait – can choose to gain a natural Ring instead of a natural Rod.
Rings can represent an innate and flexible sort of magical power, similar to how Fists represent an innate and flexible sort of martial power, while Rods can represent a power that is focused outside of the main body – such as a magical horn.

## Changelog

4 May 2020:
* The Arcane Archer and Spellsword feats have a new clause that penalizes their spell damage with certain Ranged and Melee weapons by 1. This should keep them on par with Arcane weapons.
* Magnesis Warrior can now be used to magnetically manipulate Metal non-Weapons as you would normally be able to.
* Finally, a second Master Mode has been added: allowing the choice of a natural Ring rather than a natural Rod for races with the Magical Armed trait.

19 May 2020:
* The Ring, Throwing Glove, and Summoning Gate weapons have had their Durability penalties increased to match a new understanding of the Hands-Free keyword when used on Arcane and Ranged weapons.

3 July 2020: 
* Magnesis Warrior‘s “Bound” has been corrected to “Bind”.

7 July 2020:
* Parasol Save clarifies that even Hands-Free items are placed away when the Parasol is deployed.

16 July 2020:
* Chain Rope has been updated to clarify what would happen if your Empty Hand becomes an Extending weapon. Various tables have been mildly reformatted.
