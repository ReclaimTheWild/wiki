Through Hyrule’s history, smiths continually invent more weapons, whether to slay the forces of darkness or light. A particular category of weapons involves the use of flexible materials or chains in order to create Extending weapons. Though less accurate than a typical sword or spear, these weapons allow their wielders to keep their foes at a distance, and even to use potent melee Techniques while out of their target’s reach.

Below is a list of new weapons and attacks especially favored by those who expect to deal with enemies on the ground *and* in the air. The whip in particular is favored among those who hunt blood-drinkers like the Achemen! 

## New Weapons

| Weapon                    | ACC | ATK | DUR | Edge      | Hands | Type  | Keywords                             |

*: **Chain Weapons** can either be Blunt, Piercing, or Sharp, determined when the item is first made.

### New Weapon Property: Extending

Weapons with this property can extend beyond melee range and gain the Whipcrack basic attack. In addition, characters wielding a Extending weapon can perform Combat Maneuvers from up to (Whipcrack‘s range). Extending weapons count as empty hands for the purposes of Grappling.

### New Basic Attack: Whipcrack

**Requires**: Any Extending weapon  
**Range**: Projectile 3  
**Damage**: Weapon + Combat  
**Special**: Your Extending weapon is not thrown by using this basic attack. This is considered a Melee attack for all other purposes, including Reactions. If you have the Longshot feat, increase the range of this basic attack by 2.

##  New Extending Weapon Options

Of course, a new weapon property opens the potential for more new feats and techniques that use it. Below you will find a feat and three techniques that take advantage of the Extending property!

### New Feat: Extended Lethality

*6 tokens*  
**Effect**: When you use a single target melee Spell or Technique with an Extending weapon, you can treat the Spell or Technique as having the same range as Whipcrack by paying an additional half of the Magic or Stamina cost of the attack. The Spell or Technique is still considered a Melee attack for all other purposes, including Reactions.

### New Technique: Belmont’s Whip Brandish

*3 tokens*  
**Cost**: 4 Stamina  
**Use requirement**: Any Extending weapon  
**Effect**: You brandish your whip around you. Until the end of your next turn, whenever you move adjacent to a foe or a foe moves into any square adjacent to you, that foe takes damage equal to your Combat score. While the technique is active, you may re-use it as a Minor Action.  
**Special**: Enemy projectile attacks that pass within melee range of you treat their target as Hard-to-Hit.

### New Technique: Coward’s Denial

*6 tokens*  
**Cost**: 4 Stamina  
**Use requirement**: a foe within 2 squares moves a square away from you; wielding an Extending weapon  
*Reaction*  
**Range**: 3 squares  
**Damage**: Combat  
**Effect**: Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality. If successful, your target is knocked prone. This is considered a Melee attack for all other purposes, including Reactions.

### New Technique: Tether Recovery

*3 tokens*  
**Cost**: 1 Stamina  
**Use requirement**: Wielding an Extending weapon and knocked into air  
*Reaction*  
**Effect**: You anchor the end of your weapon in the square you just left, and you cease falling.
