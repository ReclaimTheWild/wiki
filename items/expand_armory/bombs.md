Bombs are a wonderful and, some would say, core part of the *Zelda* franchise. Here are more bombs for those bombardiers itching to expand their collection!

These bombs do not require any specialized knowledge to create. Just combine the listed Materials and look at the rules for Crafting Bombs in the core rulebook.

The rank of Materials used for crafting Frag and Nail Bombs is capped at (your Smithing / 2).

The rank of Materials used for crafting the other bombs in this chart is capped at (your Enchanting / 2).

## New Rules

### New Status Effect: Deafened

While Deafened, you cannot hear. You automatically fail any Trait Rolls that rely upon hearing, and cannot hear anything that anyone is saying. In addition, abilities that require hearing (such as an [Acheman]({{ "/races/acheman" | absolute_url }})’s echolocation) no longer work.

### New Status Effect: Earthbound

You lose the ability to Fly, and cannot hover, leap, levitate, or glide higher than 2 squares from the ground. If you are already in mid-air, then you fall to the ground slowly. This lasts until the end of your next turn.

### New Terrain: Thick Smoke

Thick smoke obscures visibility, making it harder for your attacks to land. Smoke affects any attack that originates within, passes through, or targets something enveloped in the smoke. Foes within Melee range are Hard to Hit; foes further away are Extremely Hard to Hit and cannot be seen. Wind can disperse thick smoke. If the smoke’s source is persistent – such as an ongoing flame – then thin smoke will reappear in time, and will become thick smoke not long after.

### New Terrain: Thin Smoke

Thin smoke obscures visibility, making it harder for your attacks to land. Smoke affects any attack that originates within, passes through, or targets something enveloped in the smoke. Foes further than Melee range are Hard to Hit. Wind can disperse thin smoke, though, if the source is persistent, thin smoke may return at a later time.

As always, thank you to **Elemental Knight** and the people in the Discord for providing feedback and ideas.

## Changelog

2 May 2020: 
* The Dazzled status has been added to the core rulebook as part of the 2.0 update, so it has been removed from this article.
