Music has a long and storied place in the Zelda franchise. It usually doesn‚Äôt get much use within battle, though *Hyrule Warriors* show just how deadly musicians can be!

Whether to covertly assassinate a royal official, or to protect others, or just for the sheer **ùì¢ùì£ùì®ùìõùìî**, plenty of instruments have been weaponized over the course of Hyrule‚Äôs history. Click to read more about **Expressive** weapons!

**Expressive** weapons are intended to help their wielder communicate without words. They grant the wielder a bonus of (Weapon‚Äôs Rank / 2) to performing Social Maneuvers.

Redesigning instruments for battle does make it so that amateurs cannot use them like their regular Instrument equivalents. However, with proper training (represented by the Battle Bard feat below), they can once again be used as regular Instruments.

Note 1: The Bells, Dancing Shoes, Fans, Flutes, Gongs, Harps, and Microphones are entries above are purposefully built weapons instead of regular Instruments. Not all bells, dancing shoes, fans, flutes, gongs, harps, and microphones are built to be weapons. However, they can be used as improvised weaponry as appropriate, and thus typically fall apart after one battle

Note 2: Dancing Shoes, Fans, Microphones, and Ribbons can be either Blunt, Piercing, or Sharp, determined when the item is first made.

Note 3:  Portmanteau of violin + lance.

While not all possible Instruments are represented above, you can use the guidelines found in the [Design Your Weapon](https://reclaimthewild.net/index.php/2020/07/01/design-your-weapon/) article to homebrew your own!

## Quest Hooks

**The Picori Festival** is in full swing, with plenty of entertainment acts for visitors to watch. One standout event is a ribbon-dancing ceremony, featuring visiting danseuses from a faraway land. When the Festival‚Äôs combat tournament begins, though, the crowd is amazed to see one of the dancers in the arena ‚Äì armed with nothing more than her ribbon. But what could she hope to win?

**The Goddess‚Äôs Harp** is an artifact of Hyrule‚Äôs ancient history, said to have been owned by the goddess Hylia at the world‚Äôs beginning. While not as well-known as the Master Sword and the Megaton Hammer, when disaster strikes and all music is lost from the world, this Harp ‚Äì and the Hero who wields it ‚Äì may be the only thing that can restore peace to the world.

**The world of dreams is a strange one**, where the present, past, and future all commingle, hiding truth in indecipherable prophecy. When bards and songstresses the world over begin having the same dream, night after night, of a lonely island in a tumultuous sea, they must band together and explore this curious dream world to acquire potent musical weapons once used by the Hero of Legend: the Instruments of the Sirens.

## Changelog
