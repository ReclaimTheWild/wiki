# Aphra's Seed Satchel

It’s time to share another homebrewed Magical Tool – though this one is special, because it comes in parts!

Aphra, the Great Fairy of Earth and Emeralds, created a magical satchel of seeds. This simple brown sack seems to contain a nigh-infinite number of seeds in it, and when spread over the ground, they bloom fully in the blink of an eye.

However, the Satchel has room for multiple kinds of seeds, each with different magical effects. Whether the Satchel is complete, or is missing some types of seeds, is up to you.

## Aphra's Seed Satchel (Magical Tool)
{: .fs-6 }

**Cost**: 1 Magic per square affected, up to 10 Magic (Bound)  
**Range**: (Bound Magic) squares, arranged depending on the effect. (Cones and Blasts require enough Magic be bound to ‘fill’ their shapes properly.)  
*Standard Action*  
**Effect**: With a sweep of your hand, you take seeds from the Seed Satchel and sow them. Choose one of the effects below. At the end of your next turn, the seeds sprout, and the chosen effect activates.  
* Blast Bloom (Melee, Special): A large, flat flower blooms in the spot. If stood on for an entire turn, it catapults the loiterer in an arc, (Bound Magic) squares in a particular direction (chosen when planted).
* Grass (Blast, Burst, Cone, or Sweep): Tall Grass or Thick Brush fills the affects squares.
* Lily Pad (Blast, Burst, Cone, Line, or Sweep): Thick, hearty lily pads sprout. Can only be used on water. Creatures can walk on the lily pads.
* Magic Beanleaf (Melee, Special): Magic Bean plants fly up to (Bound Magic) squares straight up into the sky whenever a creature steps on them, as a Reaction. They then continue to hover for up to 5 minutes, before returning to their original position, spent.
* Vine (Line): Vines cling to the side of rocky cliffs and outcroppings (even ceilings!), making them easier to climb. This turns Difficult Terrain for climbing into normal climbing terrain.

For every square of plants grown from the Satchel’s seeds is cut down, lit on fire, or otherwise destroyed, 1 point of the Bound Magic is then Burned. The Satchel’s currently-active effect may be dispelled as a Minor Action, causing the plants to immediately wither away to nothing.

Plants made with this Satchel are ephemeral, and obviously magical. They cannot be harvested for Materials of any kind.
