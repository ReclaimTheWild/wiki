Magical Masks are a special kind of Magical Tool. They are all One-Handed Wooden tools that can be put on, or removed, as a Standard Action. Once put on, they do not occupy any equipment slot. However, you can only have one Magical Mask equipped at any time. While worn, you receive the special effect of the mask.

When using this homebrew, count "Mask of the Healed Soul" (Reclaim the Wild, page 199) as a Magical Mask. 

## Selection of Magical Masks

### All-Night Mask
**Effect**: You cannot become sleepy or tired, and magical forces prevent you from lying down for long. While you are Prone, you may stand up as a Reaction to being targeted by an attack (halving your Movement during your next turn). You may combine this with any other Reaction that require being targeted by an attack.

### Blast Mask
**Effect**: As a Standard Action, you may activate this worn mask to produce the explosion of a normal Bomb, with you at the center of the Blast. You may spend 4 Magic to produce the explosion of any Bomb that costs 40 Rupees, spend 12 Magic to produce the explosion of a Super Bomb, or spend 20 Magic to produce the explosion of a Powder Keg at the end of the third turn after activating this effect.  
**Special**: The mask is immune to the damage and effects of its own explosions, including Brushfire terrain produced by a Brushfire Bomb's explosion.

### Bunny Hood
**Effect**: While wearing the mask, you gain Hasty 2 and you treat your Athletics Rank as 2 higher if you are Jumping. These effects only apply for running on the ground and you cannot Sneak while wearing the mask.

### Couple's Mask
**Effect**: You can use Rebonak's Retort and Ravio's Hookshot for free and even if you haven't learned either, but if you do, you must target your Partner (see Special).  
**Special**: This can only be created by fusing a "Sun Mask" and a "Moon Mask", and you must hold one mask while another character holds the other mask. The other character will become your Partner. You and your Partner can only have a Couple's Mask they created in their inventory; holding a second Couple's Mask or trying to put it in your inventory instead drops that mask on an adjacent space. You or your partner may choose to permanently destroy the shared Couple's Mask to be able to carry a foreign Couple's Mask.

### Giant's Mask
**Effect:** While wearing it, your size in feet triples (usually making you two size categories larger) and you cannot be affected by other size-changing effects, including Minish Minuet. As long as you wear it, you must Burn 2 Magic immediately after starting to wear it, and at the beginning of each of your turns. If you can't pay the cost, the mask falls off your face and drops into an adjacent space before you shrink back to your normal size.

### Mask of Scents
**Effect**: You have a Knack for all rolls based on locating and identifying smells and scents. This includes surveying for Critters, Food and Monsters. Due to the mask making it hard to speak while wearing it and forcing you into a more feral posture, you suffer a -2 penalty to any rolls based on social interaction (including haggling).

### Mask of Truth
**Effect**: You can cast Lens of Truth even if you haven't learned it and you may choose to use either Stamina or Magic to pay the cost. While wearing it, treat three overlapping sources of Fair Light as Bright Light.

### Stone Mask
**Effect**: You are Invisible while wearing the mask. This counts as a magical illusion. If anyone within line of sight is capable of seeing through your Invisibility, you become Slowed and cannot remove the mask until you are out of sight.
