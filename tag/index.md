# Tag cloud

The tag cloud lists all used tags in alphabetical order. The size of the text
is related to the number of times the tag is used; the exact number is shown
on the tag pages, and in the list below.

If you would like to suggest a new tag, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/ReclaimTheWild/wiki/issues/new) and ask about it !

{% include tags/cloud.html %}

# Tag index

{% include tags/descriptions.html %}

{% comment %}
If something gets displayed here, a new _tag/ page should be created. Maybe with a description !
