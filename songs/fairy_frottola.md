While working on the previous article’s Spells, there was one Spell from *Zelda* history that just didn’t sit right with me: the “Fairy” Spell, from *Zelda II: The Adventure of Link*. It seemed like it wouldn’t be very useful in a fight, but very useful outside of a battle.

So then, it hit me: why not make it into a Song, instead of a Spell? After all, Songs are the perfect place for magical effects that are best suited to solving puzzles and navigating the world, but a poor fit for a fight.

And in this article, that’s what we’ve done! We’ve invented a new Song, *Fairy’s Frottola*. It acts like a kind of souped-up version of *Minish Minuet*; allowing Heroes to get itsy-bitsy and explore places that they otherwise couldn’t reach.

## Fairy's Frottola

*Major*  

When you play this song, you and up to (Musical Power) other persons are transformed into Fairies.

First, you shrink down to a Tiny size. While at this tiny size, your attacks can only deal 1 damage to normal-sized foes. If you are using the “Size Matters” Master Mode rules, your Hit Points and Evasion are affected by your new size appropriately.

Persons affected by the Song gain the gossamer wings commonly seen on true Fairies. You are now a Flier (but not a Natural Flier), though you are now no longer a Natural Walker.

Finally, you begin glowing with light. You may control the brightness and size of this light, from a Burst (Fortitude) down to a Burst 0 (illuminating only yourself and nothing around you), or even turn it off entirely.

You do not gain any of the further benefits of becoming a Fairy (such as being able to speak with animals). Anyone who looks at you with the Lens of Truth Spell active will be able to tell that you are not truly a Fairy.

While under the effect of Fairy’s Frottola, you retain access to your typical Racial bonuses. You may still use any Feats, Spells, or Techniques that require your ‘actual’ Race. You also retain your previous appearance, excepting your newly-shrunk size and your temporary fairy wings.

The duration of this transformation depends upon your Musical Power, per the table below. Any individual affected by this Song may dismiss its effects on them at any time, unless there is not enough room to accommodate you at your normal size. 

| Musical Power | Time Granted | Musical Power | Time Granted |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1             | 1 minute     | 6             | 4 hours      |
| 2             | 10 minutes   | 7             | 8 hours      |
| 3             | 30 minutes   | 8             | 12 hours     |
| 4             | 1 hour       | 9             | 18 hours     |
| 5             | 2 hours      | 10            | 24 hours     |

When this Song is used on person-sized Fairy Heroes, they merely shrink down, as if under the effects of *Minish Minuet*. When used on teeny-tiny Fairy Heroes, this song has no effect – or, at GM’s discretion, it may make them person-sized, or have other strange effects.
