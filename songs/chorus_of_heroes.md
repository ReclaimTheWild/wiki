## Chorus of Heroes

***Major***  

While rare even by the standards of magical songs, this sacred song is capable of breaking through barriers that would leave foes serving great evil, or even being said Great Evil, invulnerable to even Silver Arrows.

This song can be performed in combat, but only by a single character in the group at once. If you begin to perform the song while in the presence of great evil, you are protected by a transparent shell that acts as a barrier. Nothing the forces of evil can do will affect you, although other foes and natural occurences can still affect you. If you are hit by an attack or maneuver, or otherwise forced to move or knocked prone while you are performing, the song fails but can be performed again.

At the end of your fourth turn after the turn where you started to perform the song, the song has been successfully played and both your and your allies' bodies begin to glow in a gold-hued Dim Light for the duration of the scene or encounter, only bright enough to illuminate yourselves and nothing else around you. While glowing in such a way, you gain a bonus equal to your Musical Power to overcome barriers specifically made to keep heroes and the forces of good away.
You also gain additional effects depending on your Musical Power:  
* **Musical Power 3**: Your Learn Lore rolls against a force of evil is rolled twice as if you have a Knack.  
* **Musical Power 6**: After a successful hit, a force of evil's Weak Point is revealed if they are in Peril or Enraged after the attack. In addition, each affected ally may choose to glow in Fair Light and return to Dim Light as a Free action each.  
* **Musical Power 9**: Your Guard Stats are increased by 1 against attacks of the forces of evil.
