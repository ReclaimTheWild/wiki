# Crafting-Style: Yeti {% include labels/v2-01 %}

### Crafting Style: Yeti
*6 Tokens*  
**Trait Requirement**: Smithing 6  
**Effect**: You may choose to use this whenever crafting a weapon. The weapon costs 1 more Material, has 2 greater Durability, and 1 less Attack Power. Instead of suffering durability loss per turn while used for shield surfing, shields crafted in this style only suffer 1 durability loss at the end of the scene or encounter. Other weapons gain +2 Attack Power if used while Shield Surfing.
