Oh... I forgot, Inklings can only understand our language, slipped my mind. Let me repeat myself then, we have been working on improving both Inkling weaponry and those heroes who wish to fight in our style of turf war. With that, here are a few new Spells & Techniques, inspired by various weapons and specials from Splatoon 1 & 2!
