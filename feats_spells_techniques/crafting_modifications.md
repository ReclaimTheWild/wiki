Crafting Modifications are a series of Feats that give aspiring blacksmiths a ton of options to come up with exotic variants of common weapons.

Crafting Modifications can be applied in addition to a Crafting Style, and **any weapon may have up to two Crafting Modifications added to them**.

If any combination of Crafting Styles and Crafting Modifications would result in 0 or less Accuracy, Attack Power, or Durability, they remain at 1 instead, and every point of reduction that would lower it to 0 and below is converted into requiring +1 Crafting Materials instead.
