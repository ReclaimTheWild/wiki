    "content": "When they hear the word “vampire”, Hylians typically think of the Achemen. These monstrous bat-people have served the Calamity for millennia, terrorizing the people of Hyrule in the night. Standing as tall as the average Hylian, Achemen have the monstrous visage of a bat shaped into a man, with long, lanky limbs and short wings. They are covered in a light layer of fur, except on their limbs, and sport two large fangs. They have beady little eyes, ill-suited for the darkness they tend to dwell in. Achemen tend to dwell in caves, occasionally with their fellow monsters, though many venture out and infiltrate the societies of other races in disguise. Strangely, however, despite their ache form’s similarity to Keese, their caves almost never contain actual Keese. Most Achemen prefer the taste of blood, especially from unwilling and struggling citizens of Hyrule. When they can’t get their favorite meal, though, they may settle for any wild (or domesticated) creature they can get their claws on. The more considerate and discreet Achemen mainly eat fruits and insects to gain their sustenance, though if a willing person were to offer their own blood… . Art by Karma . ",

    "title": "History",
    "content": "Acheman begin their lives as simple Ache, monstrous bats not unlike Keese, though somewhat larger. During their formative years they are taken care of by their mothers, and occasionally fathers, until they learn to speak, fly, and perform dark magic. Usually, Ache society can expect an Ache to fly two paths: one in which they learn to disguise themselves as a mortal and live in mortal societies, while others instead learn the magic to become an Acheman. Few know the true origin of the Achemen, though most sages believe they were created from Keese when the Dark Lord saw the devastation that Hyrule’s Loftwing Cavalry rained upon his forces. An ancient book found in the small, riverside hamlet of Nabooru Town contains an interview with a rare, friendly Acheman. This book reports that the Acheman race passes down the legend that they were the ones who inspired the Dark Lord to bring Hyrule into eternal night. Whatever the truth of the matter, the Achemen have lived in Hyrule, be it in caves among their own, or in disguise among the populace they wish to enslave. They plot for the return of the Calamity, when they aren’t actively serving underneath it. As a whole, Acheman colonies are generally anarchic, formed of kin groups usually centered around the eldest female relative. However, intermingling is common, and oftentimes a group of Achemen fly off to establish their own colonies, go exploring, or check to see if the Dark Lord has returned. While kin groups are often named after a matriarch, the biggest divisions in Achemen society are in their philosophy. | The Infiltrators prefer living in mortal societies in disguise, so that they can better understand their prey and to sabotage attempts to fight back against them. Their spycraft most often leads to paranoia among Hylians and Sheikah, and in turn leads to trouble for the Achemen who have abandoned their common cause and try to live among other races. | The Predators live in caves and come out to openly attack mortals during the night, or otherwise actively serve the great evil’s army by scouting, coordinating, and commanding. | The Inventors are the smallest group that serve evil, opting instead to develop new weapons and other methods of defeating their foes. However, the danger they and their inventions present to both mortals and to their fellows (and superiors within the dark forces) means they are the most feared, and thus are often not welcome among Predators, Infiltrators, or factions less involved with matters of conquest and evil. | Neutrals tend to stay out of contact with non-Achemen, unless they are out feeding. They are typically the least known about, because Achemen with this philosophy tend to interact least with Hyrule’s populace. | . In time, however, a few Achemen have grown tired of the constant cycle of conflict and devastation, and have left their home colonies for a change of culture. These few Exiles, or Vagabonds, contain a seed of goodness within them, that sometimes sprouts and encourages them to help improve the world where many of their fellows only destroy. Often, though, they will be shunned, and even attacked, unless – and sometimes even despite – showing their better nature. Most rogue Achemen simply live their lives in solitude, or disguised as a Keese, though a rare few put on a magical disguise and live among others. Art by Karma . ",

    "content": "Acheman tend to place a heavy emphasis on the greater causes, be it serving the Dark Lord or following their own path. Often, without a great cause to dedicate themselves to, an Acheman tends to simply worry about their own survival and little else. When they’re withdrawn, an Acheman may have trouble attaching themselves to a new cause, but if they do, they can become a passionate believer. Acheman work best whenever they have their enemy at a disadvantage, such at night or in dark environments like caves. As such, they often prefer using stealth, hit and run tactics, deception and their flight to take advantage of their environment. When not in a better situation than their enemy, Achemen tend to be more cautious… and will attempt to flip the situation in their favor, or at least try to talk their way out of any confrontation. If nothing else works, then a simple retreat to fight another day is usually called for. Characteristics: Sadistic, Clever, Vengeful, Proactive .

While this led to having a list of Ingredients that should be amenable to a wide variety of diets, it also meant we excluded a staple substance: meat!

    "content": "Surveying for Meat sources is a Nature check, rather than the usual Civilization check. This represents not only finding the source of the Meat (such as a deer in the woods, or a good fishing spot by a river), but also the act of successfully catching and incapacitating the animal(s) in question (snaring a rabbit, spearing a fish, netting a bird). This might be different if you’re specifically searching in a civilized environment, such as hunting for pigeons to eat in a city – but such scavenging is typically frowned upon by town guards, and seen as uncouth by other hunters. It may even be illegal, such as if you rustle someone else’s cattle with the intent to turn them into your next steak dinner. Once the Meat source is scavenged, it is usually incapacitated – the animal is either already dead, or so incapacitated that you need but deliver the final blow. However, at GM discretion, the animals you’re hunting might not be so easily slaughtered, and a fight might break out. Remember: the most dangerous animal is a cornered animal. We would encourage the GM to only do this if the fight might be interesting in any way, or if its results might have other consequences – such as if the Heroes have caught some dangerous, magical creatures; or their fight might alert patrolling soldiers that the Heroes would prefer remain unaware of their presence. In most cases, it’s simply more fun to move directly to harvesting the Meat, so that the proper adventure can continue. ",

This Tool is created from Metal materials, just like other Food Harvesting Tools. At GM’s discretion, some creatures might grant other Materials (such as Monster Parts or Cloth) in addition to their Meat. Treat these as Dual-Use Resources – a double-dip bonus for the Heroes! For instance, snagging a full-grown buck might grant not only Meat, but the antlers (as Monster Parts); slaughtering a sheep would grant Meat and Cloth (in the form of its wool). ",

When a war hero’s statue is destroyed in the middle of the night, the town of Westshrine finds their luck has turned sour: their milk curdles, their crops fail to bloom, and locusts rise from the earth to eat whatever’s left. The townspeople believe they have but one recourse: to create the war hero’s favorite dish, based on notes in his journal, and offer it in sacrifice. Unfortunately, not only does the recipe require several herbs and spices, it calls for that most dangerous game: Cucco. In an effort to forge a peace with a clan of Lizalfos, the leaders of Goponga Village have organized a large feast in the Lizalfos style, complete with lots of meat for their carnivorous guests. However, the cattle that the village set aside for slaughter have gone missing! The town is now desperate to obtain a large quantity of meat, fast, to ensure the feast’s success – and to discover who sabotaged the original cattle drive. The town of Shutoy holds an epic fish-fry competition every year. Famed for its fish-laden waters, cooks and chefs travel from all over to compete in the famous contest. The fish used in the contest must come from Shutoy Lake, but may be prepared with any other spices, meats, fruits, or vegetables – the more exotic and rare the foreign ingredients, the better. The competition is fierce, and can even turn deadly while out on the water. Not only are the winners crowned Champion of Shutoy, but they receive a cooking implement or harvesting tool said to be blessed by the lake’s guardian spirit. ",

    "content": "The above Techniques and Spells make a character trade away their humanity, soul, or essence as the price for the power gained, which should be described as losing a part of what makes the character mortal and moral as the character descend into the alluring promise of easy access to a lot of power. The GM is encouraged to tempt the character with these “rewards” at least once during a session, especially if they often make (casual) use of their Blood Tribute feat and related Techniques and Spells. Luckily, heroes are often greater than life itself and they can find ways to regain what they have lost while keeping what they have gained. The following feat reflects that possibility. Restored Essence . 9 Tokens Learn Requirement: Quest Reward or GM Approval Only Effect: Reduce your Bloodthirst Rank by 1. This does not reduce temporary Bloodthirst Rank. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. The learning cost can be reduced to 6 if the character visibly shows remorse and unwillingness to use their Blood Magic, or to 3 if they are taking active efforts into making the world a better place without using Blood Magic at all. These conditions must have been fulfilled for an extended duration of time (at least one complete session) to be eligible for reducing learning costs. If the GM agrees, Restored Essence can cost 0 Tokens instead if the player character forgets one of their learned Techniques or Spells requiring Blood Tribute instead. This should be done for the purpose of rejecting, and forfeiting, the power of Blood Magic. It shouldn’t be abused and a character that learns any Technique or Spell requiring Blood Tribute after they took at least one instance of Restored Essence may have forever lost the possibility to reduce cost to 0 that way.

By default, you are always a valid target for lightning strikes, can be interacted with magnetically, and can even become Corroded. You Corrode after you are damaged when in water. See the section below on the Corroded status. | Mechanical Muncher: You can consume Metals as if they were Food ingredients of the same rank, including being able to eat Dishes made with those same Metals.

    "content": "Self-evident in their design, Bob-ombs have come into being with one purpose: destruction. These mechanical munitions are at the forefront of many conquering armies, blasting holes in fortifications and soldiers alike. Because of this, Bob-ombs have attained a reputation as being merciless, dumb, short-lived, and suicidal. Despite their uniform exterior, within every Bob-omb is a unique mind, and through the efforts of these minds they have begun to stray from their original purpose. Bob-ombs rebelled against their masters, fled, and formed friendships with other people and, most of all, each other. In time they have learned to create, and to work in non-destructive ways. These mechanical marvels have become fighters for freedom, makers of art and buildings and philosophies. This new breed of Bomb-omb has slowly chipped away at that negative stereotype, replacing it with a more positive image consisting of discipline, self-sacrifice, a bombastic attitude, and a tendency for building useful mechanisms the world over. Long after the bloody past, Bob-ombs are just like any other person wherever they live, despite their mechanical and explosive nature. They love, they feud, they mourn and most would not have it any other way. Heroic Bob-ombs are often driven by a single purpose, be it exploration, the delivery of a package, or a promise to a loved one now departed. A few are even inspired to seek out the true origin of the Bob-omb, as none have knowledge of when or where they were “born”. Many scholars speculate that they are created in factories controlled by the tyrants that use them as disposable pawns, but no one has provided any proof one way or another. Others still search for other mechanical races, to better understand the world from a seemingly kindred spirit. ",

    "content": "Though the stereotype of a Bob-omb is that of a walking black or red bomb with two legs, a key, a fuse and no arms, the truth is that there is plenty of differentiation within a single model, not to mention the various other models. In reality, many, but not all, Bob-ombs have hands that are hidden in compartments when they are not in use. Even if a Bob-omb does not have hands, they are still capable of manipulating objects as if they did. Other Bob-ombs have taken a vow of pacifism and have caps on their head instead of a fuse. Yet others lack keys, leading to scholarly speculation that wind-up Bob-ombs are made in the same place as Mechakoopas, and thus aren’t people at all. As mechanical beings, Bob-ombs have a wider palate than their fleshy compatriots, often adding metal shavings and oil to their meals. Art by Nd Cube, et al. ",

His past is shrouded in mystery, but it’s well-known that he commands a massive, multiracial army from his perch on a massive, spiral mountain, well-defended with cannons and savage Chain Chomps. Neji Bombs are Bob-ombs with a digital face, no fuse, different legs, and a key located at the top of their head. They are generally thought of as smarter than the average Bob-omb, at least with certain advanced technology. Chuck-Yas are a unique, mass-produced version of Bob-ombs, trading in two legs for a metal point, and with improved upper body strength and an antenna. These generally do not attack by exploding, but rather by picking up and tossing friends and foes alike. With hard-fought freedom and the luxuries that come with civilization, many Bob-ombs have taken to changing themselves to fit the world around them – or to better find their own true self or reflect their profession. A few have been seen attempting to get bodies that match the people around them, be they human, Hylian, Goron, Toad, and the like. Art by Intelligent Systems . ",

This feat can be taken multiple times. New Feat: Bomb Typing . 3 tokens Effect: Select an upgrade for your Bomb ability. You can now use it. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you take this, you can choose a different upgrade. New Feat: Bomb-chu Upgrade . 9 tokens Trait requirement: Bob-omb Effect: You no longer need a weapon to Charge, and can use the Bomb ability after a Charge instead of Basic Attack. In addition, you become a Natural Climber. Special: If you have the Natural Movement (Climb) feat, your tokens for that feat are immediately refunded. New Feat: Crafting Style: Bob-omb . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Smithing 6 Effect: You can choose to use this whenever crafting a weapon. The weapon costs 2 more materials, and is now considered Explosive. New Weapon Property: Explosive . This weapon can be used as a bomb that deals [(rank x2) + 1] damage. If the weapon detonates, the weapon takes 1 durability and is considered to have been used (regardless of whether someone was hurt or not). The fuse can be put out with a Water-element attack or if it is Soaked, and the weapon detonates earlier if it is hit with any Fire or Electric attack, or another bomb’s explosion. Any other attacks that target the weapon is treated as if attacking a weapon, not a bomb. New Feat: Fireproof Bomb Upgrade . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Bob-omb Effect: Your Vulnerability becomes Water and you gain 4 ranks of Heatwave Resistance. New Feat: Water Bomb Upgrade . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Bob-omb Effect: You can use your Wick Lantern bonus while Soaked, and no longer Corrode from being underwater. You can also use your Bomb ability while Soaked or underwater. Note that not all Bomb upgrades are effective underwater. For instance, the Sand-Covered and the Stained status effects will wash away the moment they are applied if the target is underwater. Special: If you have both this feat and Fireproof Bomb Upgrade, your Vulnerability becomes Shock. New Technique: Companion Chucker . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb Cost: 4 Stamina Use requirement: adjacent ally Range: Projectile 8 Damage: Combat Effect: You grab and throw an ally at a target. Damage from this attack ignores Defense. Your ally does not take damage from this technique, unless the enemy deals damage upon contact. Your ally lands next to the target. New Technique: Firework . 6 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb Cost: Up to (Athletics) Stamina Use requirement: Capable of using your Bomb ability, not underwater Effect: You send yourself flying in a straight line, using Stamina spent on this technique rather than your regular Movement (this can allow you to exceed your movement); once your turn ends, you fall as normal. You use your Bomb ability at the end of this movement. New Technique: Manufacture Ammunition, Lesser . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Armos or Bob-omb Cost: 1 Magic or Stamina (Burn) Use Requirement: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory. Range: Self Effect: Select either an Arrow or a Bomb. When you use this technique, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. This may only create normal Bombs and Arrows. Ammunition made with this technique cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest. New Technique: Manufacture Bomb, Greater . 6 tokens Learn requirement: Armos or Bob-omb Cost: 2 Magic or Stamina (Burn) Use Requirement: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory. Range: Self Effect: Select either a type of Arrow or a type of Bomb, worth no more than 50 Rupees. When you use this technique, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. Ammunition made with this spell cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest. New Technique: Reactive Bomb . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb Cost: 4 Stamina Use requirement: take Fire damage Reaction Effect: You use the Bomb ability, except your damage is equal to the Fire damage you have taken from the attack that triggered this reaction; a Bomb option that does not deal damage still does not deal damage. However, you do not take any damage from that use of Bomb. You can use this reaction even while Helpless and then die beyond the ability of a Small Fairy to recover. New Technique: Torpedo . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb, Water Bomb Upgrade Cost: Up to (Athletics) Stamina Use requirement: Swimming Effect: When using this ability, you can send yourself swimming in a straight line, using your Stamina spent rather than your movement (this can allow you to exceed your movement); you can also jump out of the water as part of this technique. You use your Bomb ability at the end of this movement. New Status Effect: Corroded . When a creature becomes Corroded, the creature’s Evasion is reduced by 3 and becomes Slowed. After a metal creature (such a Bob-omb) is damaged in combat when in freshwater, roll 2d6+(Fortitude/2)+Waterborne ranks. On a roll of 10 or less, the creature becomes Corroded. When in saltwater, metal creatures become Corroded after combat. If a creature wears metal armor, the creature becomes Slowed, and their Evasion is reduced by 1 per piece of armor that is Corroded. When a creature wearing metal armor is damaged in combat when in freshwater, roll 2d6+armor rank+Waterborne ranks for each piece of metal armor. On a roll of 10 or less, the piece of armor becomes Corroded. Waterborne rank 5 provides immunity to the Corroded status. The Corroded status can be removed in the same manner as the Rusted status.

    "content": "Below, we have a few simple ideas for how you could encourage your players to make use of this Magical Tool, if they should find it. Of course, this isn’t the limit of possibilities – just a sip from the flask, as it were. A long-forgotten waterwheel sits unused and abandoned. It might be in the middle of a stonework dam, or attached to the side of an abandoned mill, its driving creek long since dried up. This puzzle has a simple, obvious solution: just pour water on the wheel to get it moving again. However, it might serve as the beginning to further puzzles; once the waterwheel starts turning, it may bring other clockwork mechanisms to life within the structure – be they opening doors, moving platforms, crushing gears, or rolling millstones. A cave of roiling lava stands between the Heroes and their goal. Using the Bottle of Endless Water to pour cool water on the boiling liquid rock, they can slowly create a bridge of solidified volcanic rock… but the lava will quickly reheat it back to an untraversable state. On its own, this is just a tense stroll over molten doom… But if you add a few fiery foes to the mix, and make sure that the Heroes know that they must keep pouring water on the lava to keep themselves from sinking in, and you end up with a tension-filled fight that they’ll not soon forget. A sunken ship on the sea’s floor teeters on an underwater precipice. To maneuver through the broken vessel’s upturned corridors and overgrown kelp, the Heroes can use the Flask of Endless Water to fill rooms of the boat, causing the entire vessel to tilt forward or aft. Water-filled rooms might be easier to swim through, but harder to investigate. And of course, filling too many rooms on one side might cause the entire sunken ship to tumble into the abyss… . ",

They are shorter and lighter in weight than their mountain brethren. They are still recognizable by their potbellies and chestnut-shaped heads.

The point value of “type &amp; hands” is explained in the next chart, while the point value of Keywords are explained in the chart after that.

After adding up the values of keywords, and the type &amp; hands, you must add at least 1 Accuracy, and may provide any modifier to Attack and Durability, as long as the final result is 8 points. ines . Accuracy should be between 2 and 5. 2 is the recommended minimum because a weapon with 1 Accuracy is a possibly frustrating and inaccurate weapon, and to ensure that using an Accuracy-reducing Crafting Style actually imposes a penalty. Attack should be between -2 and +3. Durability should be between -3 and +3. Basic attacks should not be changed by weapons or keywords. Instead, leave the changes for Styles, or make up your own keyword that grants a new basic attack. Defensive and Summoning weapons should likely not have positive Durability, as their main benefits bypass the need for Accuracy and Attack. The one exception is two-handed Defensive weapons, as presumably they are still going to be used for attacking. Generally speaking, Weapons should have only one Edge type when crafted. A Weapon having one, two, three, or even more Edge types before crafting does not affect its budget at all. As always, one’s own judgment and experience should also be used when designing weapons – as well as your GM’s permission, if you are a player. Although you can add or subtract individual elements from a weapon type (such as removing Sweeping or Wizardly, adding Strike or Shoot Arrow), this is generally not recommended. All weapons of a particular type (Arcane, Melee, Ranged) should have particular base functions that allow them to be roughly on par with each other. If you wish to use a weapon in an unconventional way (such as having a weapon that is a combination of two or three categories), the feats from the Hyrule Warriors article may be preferable, as they require the spending of tokens rather than using up the weapon budget to get a more versatile, yet weaker, weapon. However, here are the values if you want to have weapons that fit into multiple types: . | TYPE &amp; HANDS | KEYWORDS GRANTED | POINT VALUE | . | 1H Arcane &amp; Melee | Wizardly | 7 | . | 1H Arcane &amp; Ranged | Wizardly | 6 | . | 1H Melee &amp; Ranged |   | 6 | . | 2H Arcane &amp; Melee | Sweeping, Wizardly | 7 | . | 2H Arcane &amp; Ranged | Wizardly | 5 | . | 2H Melee &amp; Ranged | Sweeping | 6 | . | 1H Arcane, Melee &amp; Ranged | Wizardly | 8 | . | 2H Arcane, Melee &amp; Ranged | Sweeping, Wizardly | 8 | . Explanations for all values will be placed at the end of the document. Keywords should mainly add a Weapon-related quality, conditional number boost, or access to new Basic Attacks. Any utility-related benefits – such as letting Long weapons be used for increasing the height of your jumps – should be separate Feats that are attached to a particular Keyword. Esoteric or conditional effects might even be better off as Enchantments or bespoke Magical Tools. ",

This weapon isn’t a very good weapon because it breaks the guidelines for minimum Accuracy, Attack, and Durability, and so it is unlikely to be used for actually attacking. This means that most of the keywords (Extending, Long, Returning, Sweeping) are either going to be hampered by the poor modifiers, ignored in combat favor of their utility, or are useless. With the Defensive keyword, the weapon at least provides access to the Deflect basic reaction, even if the Durability penalty will make it an expensive proposition. The Summoning and Wizardly keywords provide the obvious way to bypass most of the poor stats: by using those keywords to summon up an ally to do your fighting for you. However, the Durability penalty makes it slightly more expensive than the Summoning Gate, though with the added benefit of Defensive, and the utility of the other keywords. ",

    "title": "Explanation",
    "content": "Anything in this section should not be combined with the system as it is described in the first section. The point costs for the weapon types &amp; handedness are broken down in this section, so adding, say, “1H Melee weapon”, “Strike”, “Parry”, and “Throw Weapon” together will result in much higher points than what they are really worth. Generally speaking, the design philosophy for weapons is mostly based upon setting a baseline (worth 0 points) and then granting costs for what goes above that baseline in some way. Above the baseline is mostly in terms of: . | 1 point for each target above the baseline (1) | 1 point for every 2 squares in range above the baseline (melee 1, ranged 4) | Cost of using the attack | Conditional benefits | . Let’s start with the two categories that define a weapon: handedness, and type (arcane, melee, ranged). Handedness . Handedness is simple: two-handed weapons are considered the baseline, because only carrying one weapon is the baseline compared to carrying two. If you attack with a greatsword, a staff, or a bow, you will only have that weapon to benefit from. In contrast, you can hold a 1H weapon in one hand, which can lead to benefits such as holding a shield (to get a use of Deflect), or a different type of weapon (for attacking close and far), or using one hand to cling to a wall or a rope. As such, 2H weapons start with 0 points, and 1H weapons start with 2. Arcane, melee, and ranged weapons have different benefits, such as access to certain basic attacks and keywords by default. Defensive Basic Attacks . The main factor in defensive basic attacks is how many attack ranges they can be used against. Parry is the baseline defensive basic attack, because it can only be used against Line, Melee, and Sweep attacks. In contract, Deflect can be used against any attack. | BASIC ATTACK | FACTORS | POINT VALUE | . | Deflect | Unlimited applicability (3 pt) | 3 | . | Parry | Limited applicability (1 pt) | 1 | . Keyword connection: The Defensive keyword grants Deflect. Deflect is worth 2 points for melee weapons because the 3rd point is achieved by removing Parry. Melee Basic Attacks . Melee basic attacks are those that have the benefit of attacking enemies in melee without suffering a penalty. The costs of melee basic attacks are based upon the number of possible targets, and the distance of the attacks from the user. | BASIC ATTACK | FACTORS | POINT VALUE | . | Painful Touch | Distance: 1 square (0 pt)Targets: 1 (1 pt) | 1 | . | Punch | Distance: 1 square (0 pt)Targets: 1 (1 pt) | 1 | . | Stab | Distance: 2 squares (0.5 pt)Targets: 2 (2 pt) | 2 | . | Strike | Distance: 1 square (0 pt)Targets: 1 (1 pt) | 1 | . | Sweep | Distance: 1 square (0 pt)Targets: 2 (2 pt) | 2 | . | Whipcrack | Distance: 3 squares (1 pt)Targets: 1 (1pt) | 2 | . Keyword connection: . | Extending grants Whipcrack. | Hands-free grants Painful Touch and Punch. | Long grants Stab. | Sweeping grants Sweep. | . As you may notice, though Stab is technically worth 2.5 pts, it is rounded down to 2 because the differences between Line 2 and Sweep 2 are not sufficient to be worth 1 point. If a weapon has access to one melee basic attack, the benefits of the other melee basic attacks are diminished. As such, if a weapon has access to any melee basic attack, the value of other attacks (such as Painful Touch, Punch, Stab, Sweeping, and Whipcrack) are decreased by 1. For example, if a Ranged weapon had the Stab and Sweeping keywords, those keywords would cost 3 points total (2 for Stab, 1 for Sweeping). Hands-Free weapons are worth 2 points with Arcane and Ranged weapons, due to the benefits that Painful Touch and Punch provide. This is in contrast to Melee weapons, which only derive a slight benefit from Painful Touch (use of Willpower with a melee basic attack instead of Combat) and thus only gains 1 point of value from the Hands-Free keyword. Charge is not taken into account. This is because it is a basic attack with certain benefits and drawbacks, so it may be roughly considered as worth less than 1 point, and thus subsumed under the benefits of Strike. Sneak Attack is baseline for all weapon types, so it is worth 0 points. Ranged Basic Attacks . Ranged basic attacks have two factors in their cost: their range and their cost. 4 squares are the baseline range, used for Throw Weapon (2H). Every 2 squares above that is worth 1 point. The baseline cost is the weapon itself. Though the weapon can potentially be retrievable, you will still have one less weapon in that battle unless you give up the non-damage main benefits of making a ranged attack (distance from enemy, not dealing with terrain). Compared to losing a weapon, ammunition is a step up even though you must spend more Rupees and/or Materials to power your basic attacks. In addition, ammunition provides flexibility in damage type and other benefits. So in the end, ammunition is considered to be worth 1 point. No cost certainly costs a lot less compared to ammunition, but unfortunately also loses a lot of the flexibility provided by the special ammunition types. So it too is worth 1 point. As such, costs for ranged basic attacks are as follows: . | BASIC ATTACK | FACTORS | POINT VALUE | . | Magic Salvo (1H) | Cost: None (1 pt)Range: 6 (1 pt) | 2 | . | Magic Salvo (2H) | Cost: None (1 pt)Range: 8 (1 pt) | 3 | . | Dross Toss | Cost: None (1 pt)Damaged: Limited (-2pt)Range: 6 (1 pt) | 0 | . | Shoot Arrow (1H) | Cost: Ammo (1 pt)Range: 6 (1 pt) | 2 | . | Shoot Arrow (2H) | Cost: Ammo (1 pt)Range: 8 (2 pt) | 3 | . | Throw Weapon (1H) | Cost: Weapon (0 pt)Range: 6 (1 pt) | 1 | . | Throw Weapon (2H) | Cost: Weapon (0 pt)Range: 4 (0 pt) | 0 | . Keyword connection: . | Hands-Free grants Dross Toss. | The Returning keyword removes the cost of Throw Weapon. | . For Arcane and Ranged weapons, which have access to both Throw Weapon and their categorically exclusive basic attack, the better of the basic attacks’ costs are taken. This is mostly because, with few exceptions, few would actually want to use Throw Weapon instead of Magic Salvo, Shoot Arrow, or… just switch out to a different weapon. Although Dross Toss’s limited damage indicates that it should be the baseline… The reality is that the damage makes Dross Toss a very niche attack, and so Dross Toss is worth 0 points. Sneak Attack is baseline for all weapon types, so it is worth 0 points. Keywords . Keywords are a catch-all term for aspects of weapon design that can be applied to more than one category of weapon. Their costs are detailed near the beginning of this article. If a keyword provides access to a basic attack, see the sections above for an explanation of their point value. Any changes to Combat Maneuver ranges by Keywords is not taken into account in the point value. This is because on a general basis no Combat Maneuver effect is as potent as the Helpless or Dead condition caused by damage. Defensive grants a bonus when using the Defend action, but it is relatively minor compared to the benefits of Deflect. Explosive grants the use of a reusable mini-bomb linked to a weapon. It has been given a value of 2 points because it’s more significant than most 1 point value keywords. Expressive grants a scaling bonus to Social Maneuvers for a value of 1 point. The Hands-Free keyword provides various benefits, some of which are more niche than others, that add up to roughly 1 point. Here is a partial list: . | The scaling bonus to Combat Maneuvers are as useful as Combat Maneuvers tend to be. | The user can grab an item from their pack and use it in the same turn without keeping their weapon sheathed. | The user can climb a wall and use a 2H weapon, or two 1H weapons, and can continue moving after attacking. | The user can use a weapon while grappling with someone the same size as them. | . Messy provides a scaling bonus to damage, but it applies on a 1/turn basis that benefits the next person to attack. So it is worth approximately 1 point. Summoning provides a flexibility to your summoning spell, by automatically applying both the weapon style and the enchantment on your weapon to your summon’s weapon. Although weapon styles are roughly equivalent to each other, this is still a benefit that can provide extra damage, accuracy, or miscellaneous benefits to a potentially powerful summon, in a manner more convenient than handing the summon a weapon from your belt. So each benefit is worth approximately 1 point each, thus leading to Summoning’s total value of 2 points. Wizardly is worth 1 point, so that Arcane weapons are slightly behind Melee and Ranged weapons with basic attacks, but are on par (or ahead) when casting spells. Weapon Types . Weapon Types provides access to basic attacks and certain keywords. Here is the break down for their point values, based upon what was explained up above: . | TYPE | HANDEDNESS | DEFENSIVE | MELEE | RANGED | KEYWORD | TOTAL | . | 1H Arcane | (2 pt) |   |   | Magic Salvo 1H (2 pt) | Wizardly (1 pt) | 5 | . | 2H Arcane | (0 pt) |   |   | Magic Salvo 2H (3 pt) | Wizardly (1 pt) | 4 | . | 1H Melee | (2 pt) | Parry (1 pt) | Strike (1 pt) | Throw Weapon 1H (1 pt) |   | 5 | . | 2H Melee | (0 pt) | Parry (1 pt) | Strike (1 pt) | Throw Weapon 2H (0 pt) | Sweeping (1 pt) | 3 | . | 1H Ranged | (2 pt) |   |   | Shoot Arrow 1H (2 pt) |   | 4 | . | 2H Ranged | (0 pt) |   |   | Shoot Arrow 2H (3 pt) |   | 3 | . This system does not take into account how good Spells or Techniques that require a certain type of weapon can be. This is because the weapons are balanced around the possibility of a person only using the Basic Attacks available to them. In addition, Spells and Techniques are numerous, variable, and have their own boons and drawbacks built in, so the general thought is to consider them all approximately equal as far as Weapon Types go. Finally, tokens are normally required to buy Spells and Techniques, so the benefits do not “count” toward the weapon budget. For weapon type combinations, the costs are placed together with the following modifications: . | Handedness cost only applies once. | Throw Weapon’s costs are removed, due to its inferiority compared to Magic Salvo and Shoot Arrow. | Magic Salvo and Shoot Arrow’s ranged benefits overlap, so the cost of the range of the second ranged attack is removed. | .

This set of cards contains 135 different cards; some with mechanical effects, many with, appropriately enough, dramatic effects that may change the course of actions of an NPC, a monster, the environment or the story as a whole. The cards are sorted into different “values” - copper, silver, gold and platinum; generally reflecting how rarely you should award these cards. As a rule of thumb, a good ratio would one of 8:4:2:1, so that the copper cards show up a great deal more often. Whatever the case, I recommend you only use these cards if you’re confident as a GM. The cards are also sorted by type of action - Adventure, Assist, Attack, Combat, Defense, Movement, Recovery, Subplot and Meta; these categories are pretty self-explanatory, and their purposes for drama cards are deliberately vague; it’s just another means to allow you to sort through cards you may or may not want your players to have access to, or perhaps only use in certain situations. Using a card itself, in-game, takes no action, although there are cards that can only be used under special circumstances. There is no limit to how many cards a player may have, or how many a player may use at any given time; however, once again, this is just how I’m using them; you can limit a player to a set “hand” of cards, forcing them to discard a card if they want a new one, you may limit how many can be used at once, or when they can be used. Find the way they best suit your campaign, and use them as you see fit. If you don’t want to print each low-rarity card multiple times, or for some online solutions, you may prefer to roll for card rarity. In that case, you should use the following guidelines: . | d20 | Rarity | . | 1-10 | Copper | . | 11-16 | Silver | . | 17-19 | Gold | . | 20 | Platinum | .

    "content": ". | Dyeberries | Quest Hooks &amp; Usage Ideas | . Breath of the Wild featured a unique and versatile dyeing system. It allowed players to express themselves by dyeing their armor, at the cost of some items and Rupees. However, as much as Reclaim the Wild shares that goal of self-expression, and as much as we try to follow Breath of the Wild‘s lead in all things, this system simply doesn’t translate well to tabletop RPG play. First and foremost, the Hateno dye method requires knowing the colors of all the varied items and materials Heroes find – which is easier to track in a video game, where each item has an icon unique to it, than when all you have is the spoken word. For another, the method doesn’t translate well to all the things a Hero might want to dye: not only their arms and armor, but their hair, their skin, their ink and chalk, and even their foods. To that end, today, we’re presenting an alternative means to dye one’s items. To do this, we’re going to take a page from the Pokémon anime, of all places, by introducing a new type of item: Dyeberries. We’ll also discuss a few additional reasons you might want to scrounge up some Dyeberries, above and beyond fashion. Check ’em out below! . ",

    "content": "Art by Pokémon Dream World . Dyeberries are a new type of Food Material. Rather than having effects that boost one’s Traits or other crunchy stats, each Dyeberry has an associated color: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, Black, or White. While any Dyeberry of a given color will give you that particular hue, higher-quality Dyeberries might give richer, more vibrant colors. (If your GM does not specify a Rank for a Dyeberry, it defaults to Rank 1.) . Dyeberries can be eaten raw, just like other Food Materials; in fact, some people will do this just to temporarily dye their tongues. They can also be used in Dishes and Elixirs, as normal, providing the typical benefit of (Rank) points towards the prepared substance (and tinting it, of course). However, when prepared together with at least one Critter, Dyeberries can make Dyes. Dyes are a new type of Elixir, though unlike most Elixirs, they do not restore any Health, Magic, or Stamina. Instead, using a Dye on an item will change some or all parts of that item to match the consumed Dye. Since a Dye can be made with multiple Dyeberries, you can mix and match the Dyeberries’ colors to get the exact hue you need. The new coloration provided by a Dye is semi-permanent: normal wear and use won’t ruin the new coloration, though a dyed item can be returned to its original hues with an application of Soap. At GM’s discretion, some types of significant exertion might also wash a Dye out: while a peaceful swim likely won’t make your colors run, tumbling over a waterfall very well might. (If something is stained with an uncooked Dyeberry, that discoloration will only last until the next Extended Rest, though the stain can also be treated with Soap, as above.) . Dyes can be used on more than just arms and armor, though. A Dye can be applied to any individual person or item! (Or a quantity of Miscellaneous Tools, Arrows, or Bombs, per the Dye’s Rank and that item type’s specific quantity-crafting tables as in the Core Rulebook.) Here’re some more ideas for ways to use Dyes: . | By applying a Dye to a person, you can dye their hair, apply a henna tattoo, or even (as eye-drops) change their eye color. Skilled Sheikah infiltrators will sometimes do this, as dyes are not detected by the Lens of Truth spell. | By using a Dye on an Ink &amp; Quill set, you can change the color of the ink. Useful for writing festive missives, or otherwise adding some color to your correspondence. | Applying a Dye to a set of Balloons, Candles, or Chalk to give your temporary lighting, writing, or flighting some extra flair. | By applying 3 units of Dye to an Amenity, or 10 units of Dye to a Building, you can change the color of a structure to match your personal tastes. | And of course, you can apply a Dye to any already-prepared Dish or Elixir to give it some extra color (or you can just include Dyeberries in the original recipe). | .

    "content": "The town of Azulia has a curious commandment: all persons in the town must wear at least one blue item. Anyone who fails to wear blue is totally ignored by the townspeople; if one were to bump into an Azulian sans blue, they would act confused, embarrassed – or even afraid. When spoken to by someone wearing some amount of blue, however, they’re quick to sing the praises of a traveling priest named Cyan, and how his teachings have brought peace and prosperity to Azulia. A hidden dungeon is heavily themed on colors. Within it, the floors and fixtures are brightly painted, either red, blue, or green – and similarly-colored foes have a tendency to blend into those hues, becoming more powerful and Harder to Hit. To survive this dungeon’s trials and claim its variegated treasures, Heroes should go in well-armed with Dyeberries and Dyes, to change the colors of enemies, puzzle pieces, and themselves. Mantilla, an Inkling, leads the resistance against the evil wizard Karnyx and his undead minions. She and her rag-tag group, the Hip Hellions, use Splat Bombs to cover parts of the conquered city of Frigiliana with thick, colorful ink. To an untrained eye, this seems like mere grafitti, intended to get under Karnyx’s (lack of) skin… But by wearing deeply-dyed clothing, the Hellions can sneak through the Ink-Daubed terrain, and the Stalfos patrolling the streets never see ’em coming. When the Heroes drop in to help Mantilla’s efforts, they’ll need to get hip to these funky-fresh tactics, or face an uphill battle. ",

While working on the previous article’s Spells, there was one Spell from Zelda history that just didn’t sit right with me: the “Fairy” Spell, from Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It seemed like it wouldn’t be very useful in a fight, but very useful outside of a battle. So then, it hit me: why not make it into a Song, instead of a Spell? After all, Songs are the perfect place for magical effects that are best suited to solving puzzles and navigating the world, but a poor fit for a fight. And in this article, that’s what we’ve done! We’ve invented a new Song, Fairy’s Frottola. It acts like a kind of souped-up version of Minish Minuet; allowing Heroes to get itsy-bitsy and explore places that they otherwise couldn’t reach. ",

While at this tiny size, your attacks can only deal 1 damage to normal-sized foes. If you are using the “Size Matters” Master Mode rules, your Hit Points and Evasion are affected by your new size appropriately. Persons affected by the Song gain the gossamer wings commonly seen on true Fairies. You are now a Flier (but not a Natural Flier), though you are now no longer a Natural Walker. Finally, you begin glowing with light. You may control the brightness and size of this light, from a Burst (Fortitude) down to a Burst 0 (illuminating only yourself and nothing around you), or even turn it off entirely. You do not gain any of the further benefits of becoming a Fairy (such as being able to speak with animals). Anyone who looks at you with the Lens of Truth Spell active will be able to tell that you are not truly a Fairy. While under the effect of Fairy’s Frottola, you retain access to your typical Racial bonuses. You may still use any Feats, Spells, or Techniques that require your ‘actual’ Race. You also retain your previous appearance, excepting your newly-shrunk size and your temporary fairy wings. The duration of this transformation depends upon your Musical Power, per the table below.

While there can be Magical Tools in the form of rings, the Rings listed in this section are of a special variant, since they have been grown instead of crafted and bestow its wearer unique magical effects. To differentiate between regular magical rings and grown Rings, the latter are commonly called Gasha Rings. Characters can have as many Gasha Rings as they can carry (occupying Tool slots in the pouch as normal), but can only effectively equip one at the same time. To do so, a character must get “attuned” to it by taking an Extended Rest and, at the end of it, deciding on which of the Gasha Rings the character possesses they should attune to. Once attuned to a Gasha Ring, they occupy a “Gasha Ring” slot and no longer occupy the Tool slot in the character’s pack as long as they’re attuned to it. Gasha Rings will automatically fit the character’s finger perfectly once attuned, so there’s no need to make sure it’s the right size during crafting. Some Gasha Rings must be activated before their effect can be unleashed, noted by (Activated) behind the Gasha Ring’s name. Unless otherwise stated, activating a Gasha Ring takes a Free Action to do so. Rank 0 Gasha Rings count as Rank 1 Gasha Rings for effects, but after attuning to them, they crumble to dust at the end of the next Extended Rest. Crafting a Gasha Ring costs 1 Gem and 3 Metals of the Gasha Ring’s Rank and requires a cooking vessel. You may only craft a Gasha Ring of a Rank equal to (your Enchanting / 2), rounded down, and all Materials used must be of a Rank equal to the Gasha Ring’s Rank or higher. Once crafted, the character gains a Gasha Seed with a color and Rank corresponding to the Gem used. The Seed must be planted in soft soil. Once done so, the Seed instantly sprouts and after a number of days equal to (Gasha Ring’s Rank + 1), the sprout becomes a small tree carrying a Gasha Nut. Picking the Gasha Nut makes the tree disappear into the ground, as if its growth would suddenly reserve rapidly. The soft soil becomes usable again. Then, the Gasha Nut can be simply cracked open to reveal the crafted Gasha Ring. Gasha Seeds must be planted in the same biome as the Gem used for crafting it would normally be found (for example, if an Opal has been used, a character should seek out soft soil on beaches or next to rivers). If the Gasha Seed has been planted in an ill-suited environment, the sprout instead takes a number of weeks equal to (Gasha Ring’s Rank + 1) to grow into a tree. The market value for Gasha Rings is the same as for Mundane Tools. Gasha Seeds have half that market value, but you don’t know what Gasha Ring will sprout from it if bought - you only know the Gem used for crafting and the Rank of the Gasha Ring inside. Several people have been tempted by a cheap high-ranking Gasha Seed only to get a useless Cursed Ring in return, so beware. ",

You can activate this Ring up to (Rank) times before requiring an Extended Rest. | Sheikah Ring (Activated): Once activated, you become Invisible as long as you are sneaking.

The transformation is predetermined when this Ring is generated and the Ring’s name should reflect what it transforms the user into, but the transformation itself will always look like the “average” member of that race or monster.

Happy holidays! ‘Tis the season to bring your friends together, tell them how much you appreciate them in your lives, and – if you’re feeling particularly nice – to give them gifts. In my campaigns, I make it a yearly tradition to give gifts to my players’ characters. These often involve partaking in some light-hearted, low-stakes adventure, alongside a kindly old man with white hair and a flair for subtle, peaceful magic. Regardless of the details of the adventure, though, at its end, the Heroes of my games receive gifts. Not just random tchotchkies, either – things that are really ‘picked out’ for that particular Hero. Below, I’ll talk a bit about the kinds of gifts you can give your Heroes in your Reclaim the Wild campaign. ",

You may even want to ask your players for a wish-list, though make it clear that they won’t necessarily get everything they ask for, or exactly what they’ve written. It’s okay to go a little above and beyond. Homebrewed items and Feats are a great giveaway this time of year; their “hand-crafted” nature adding to the special-ness of the gift. However, try not to give your Heroes gifts that totally break the game’s challenge over its knee! This is a fun holiday treat, not a wish-fulfillment frenzy. Get things they’ll be thankful for, again and again. It’s better to give a gift that the Hero has to actively use – that way, they’ll have a chance to remember that it was a gift, and be thankful for it. ",

    "content": "The most obvious type of gift to give Heroes, of course, would be new arms &amp; armor. While it’s unlikely a Hero will look for a gift receipt for their new sword or sabatons, these also don’t make terribly satisfying gifts to receive, particularly in Reclaim. Weapons eventually break, and a Hero is likely to have at least a couple of weapons on their person to deal with various situations; armor is relatively passive, simply giving the Hero a bonus while worn. If you want to give your Hero some new combat equipment, though, you can focus your attention on the item’s Enchantment. Even without going above and beyond, and creating a new Enchantment to put on the gear, you can tailor the equipment to something the Hero needs – or will need. If you know your party’s going to face the trials of the Fire Temple soon, give them some water-enchanted weapons and some fire-proof hats. That way, they can feel thankful for their new gift every time they take a hit from a lava-monster. Recommendation: If you want to give a Hero some new arms or armor, we recommend giving them an item that’s one Rank above their usual loadout, pre-loaded with a suitable Enchantment. For instance, a Hero who’s got mostly Rank 3 armor would likely enjoy a Rank 4 headpiece, already enchanted to handle their next adventure. ",

    "content": "A holiday gift more in line with our modern-day sensibilities, Heroes are likely to appreciate getting a new Mundane or Magical Tool! They’re useful, they don’t wear out, and they enable Heroes to do more things and get more resources in the long run. When giving Tools, try and think of a situation the Heroes recently had trouble with, that could’ve been solved with a clever application of the right Tool – even if the players weren’t clever enough to think of that use in the moment. For instance, if they had trouble with a cliff-climbing adventure a few weeks ago, a brand-new Rope or Hook would be most appreciated (and perhaps a little groaned-at). Giving Magical Tools may be pushing the boundaries of what is and is not “too good” as a gift, since they can be used to solve a wide variety of challenges. They’re also relatively “expensive”, since each Magical Tool needs to be hand-made by the GM. However, given their cachet and importance in Zelda games, it’s hard to resist their allure! Just be aware of their increased stature and value when you give them. Recommendation: Much like with armor and weapons, try to give Heroes Mundane Tools that beat their usual loadout by one Rank, and befit a challenge they will face, or recently did face. When giving Magical Tools, we suggest giving just one Magical Tool to the whole party as a ‘group gift’. ",

Recommendation: Nobody will turn up their nose at more resources, but it isn’t exciting to receive. Keep the idea in your back pocket, for if you just can’t come up with anything else – or use them as stocking-stuffers, small gifts to whet players’ appetites while they wait to open their presents.

One exception, though, is the Powder Keg. Giving your players one Powder Keg – just one, for the whole group! – will put a devilish smile on their faces, as they consider just what kinds of shenanigans they can get up to with a potent explosive. Even if they never use it (for fear of there being some even bigger, badder thing they could use it on), they’ll always want to, and that alone is enough to warm any adventurer’s heart. Recommendation: Much like weapons, if you want to give ammunition, give ammo that you think the Hero will likely find useful in an upcoming adventure, generally in a small ‘stack’ (10 units or so). Much like money, they can make a good stocking-stuffer. ",

Using the rules in Rebuild the Wild, Heroes can own buildings of all shapes and sizes, from humble houses to full-blown castles – and you can easily put the deed to a building in a box, and hand that to your Heroes. Gifting a Building not only gives a Hero a place to hang up their cloak between adventures, it also gives them some responsibility. As the owner of a house, they may need to personalize it with furniture and their Tokens, or at least, clean up when guests come calling; as the owner of a business, they’ll need to find a good Employee to manage it; if you grant the Heroes a Castle, well, now they have responsibility over a whole swath of the countryside! . In any case, they’ll now feel responsible for protecting their Building from thieves, evildoers, and poor houseguests – all of which can serve as potential quest-hooks for future adventures. After all, nothing gets a Hero on the warpath quite like a bad guy messing with their stuff / employees / home / village. Keep in mind that most Buildings also generate income for their owners, which may result in additional homework for someone (be it GM or Player) – and in additional resources for that player down the line, since they didn’t lay down the hefty initial cost for the Building in the first place. Recommendation: Buildings may work best as a group-gift to the entire party, unless you’re giving each Hero their own House or the like (or only one Hero shows interest in running a business). ",

Maybe it’s a hand-written letter from a friend, asking for help in a time of trouble; a lead from a colleague, about a new, lucrative opportunity; an invitation from a frenemy, to a duel or a challenge to settle who’s the best. Giving your players Quest Hooks as a gift might seem a bit strange – after all, it’s not something material, or even immediately useful! But as long as the Quest Hook is crafted by the GM with care, and pays attention to the Hero and their player specifically, they can be very nice gifts indeed. Quest Hooks are best built as side-quests – things the players can choose to do, whenever it suits them. They should be specifically tied to the individual who receives the gift, in either (or both!) their initial invitation or the action of their adventure. It’s a good idea to reference a Hero’s backstory, a favorite NPC they met on their travels, or a prior adventure they really enjoyed. As such, you likely want to keep the individual quests relatively short, no more than a session or two – they’re distracting from the main plot, after all, and they’re shining the spotlight on one Hero over the others. Of course, the side-quest itself should have its own rewards; Heroes should always be compensated for their time. It should also be just as challenging as any side-quest; the gift isn’t in an “easy win”, but in undertaking a challenge that has a personal element to it. Recommendation: Quest Hooks are always a good gift, so long as you don’t bury the main plot of your campaign for too long as the players follow up on them. The more ‘personal’ the stakes and elements of the quest are to the player that receives them, the better the gift is. ",

    "title": "Feats, Songs, Spells, and Techniques",
    "content": "Last but not least: one potent holiday gift idea is to give your Heroes a new Feat, Song, Spell, or Technique. These make great personalized gifts! . Feat – If the Hero accomplished some truly ridiculous bit of heroics, or wants to specialize in something that the existing Reclaim rules simply don’t cover, then a custom Feat is a wonderful way to acknowledge their efforts. Perhaps the Hero who struggled mightily while tied up by the bad guy gets a feat that lets them fight even better while bound; or the Hero who emphasizes durable equipment gets a new Crafting Style, named in their honor, that pushes a weapon’s Durability better than before. You can also use a Feat to modify a Hero’s favorite Spell or Technique. For instance, allowing an always-disguised Hero to use Impa’s Disguise on her friends, or letting a Spin Attack-happy Hero fling foes out of their radius. These modifiers should be built as a choice, with additional cost – that way, the Hero can always choose whether to use the original action as written, or their holiday-enhanced version. Spells and Techniques – If a Hero enjoys using Spells and Techs of a particular type or style, or has a favorite weapon combination, then you can build a Spell or Technique that builds upon those ideas. If a Hero loves summoning terrain features to mess with foes and solve puzzles, grant them a new Spell to summon a new kind of terrain! Or for the Hero who loves calling on their friends in their Techniques, give them a new Technique that lets them call upon their allies in new ways. Songs – Magical Songs are a potent force in the Zelda universe, so it’s natural to want to bring some new music into your holiday celebrations. This could be as simple as giving the Hero Songs to contact beloved allies, or enact large-scale effects that they couldn’t do before. Try to remember any problems that your party wished they could solve by Song – or find a piece of music that inspires you, or that your player deeply enjoys, and build a new Song effect around that. Recommendation: While they’re the most work to create, custom Feats, Songs, Spells, and Techniques are also the most heartfelt and meaningful gifts a GM can give their players. Try to keep their (theoretical!) Token costs about the same, and don’t charge the players Tokens to learn their new skills – nobody wants to get a bill for Christmas. ",

But there are more ways to gain property than just planting a flag in the ground and deciding to construct a building!

And where there are NPCs, and rewards to be earned, there’s opportunity for adventure. | The Heroes have been tasked by the Rowen Trading Guild to remove a corrupt member of theirs, Gesimund, who owns the only Weapon Shop for miles. Gesimund controls a band of back-alley brigands, preventing others from buying or selling weapons in his territory (and also, unbeknownst to the bandits, ensuring there’s always a demand). The Guild is sick of the complaints from other merchants, but can’t afford the fallout or the risk of directly acting against him. The Heroes could deal with him by roughing up his ruffians, cutting off his supply chain, or even buying him out. Once Gesimund is gone, the Rowan Trading Guild might decide to give his old shop’s license to the Heroes – not just to reward them, but to keep them close at-hand. | Clearing an Inn of unwanted monsters is a rite of passage for many novice Heroes.

A common trope in fantasy gaming is that of the “demi”. Be it a half-elf, a half-orc, a half-dragon, or even a half-god, there have been heroes of curious parentage since time immemorial. (In fact, the very first hero of a fantasy story, Gilgamesh, is one-third human, and two-thirds god!) . While this trope doesn’t seem to occur in Zelda games, that doesn’t prevent players from wanting their Heroes to hail from more than just one race. If anything, the franchise’s wide variety of strange and wondrous people encourages such thought. But how do you square that with the total lack of examples from any of the games? In addition, how do you prevent a player from developing a knotted, convoluted family tree, just for the sake of min-maxing? . Below, we offer a ruleset for creating Heroes of Curious Parentage, and some advice on preventing those abuses of one’s ancestry. ",

    "content": "For the purposes of these rules, we assume that when two people in a Zelda world have a child, that child is then of the mother’s Race, whether or not they inherited any particular traits from their father. In short, the child of a Sheikah woman and a Hylian man would simply be Sheikah, not “Sheikah/Hylian”. This helps prevent some of the obvious questions that can come up in these discussions, such as “why are there still Gerudo if they have to take boyfriends from the Hylian population”. These rules also make no effort to answer the “how” or “why” of inter-species conception. Whether a particular couple of differing species can conceive a child is left as a discussion between the GM and the player, though these rules do not themselves prevent it. (So if you want to be the secret child of a Zora and a Goron, these rules can help make that a reality, but only if your GM is okay with that. We aren’t even going to try to explain how that would work.) . ",

    "title": "Primary &amp; Secondary Race",
    "content": "When making a child of two different Races, first select a “Primary” Race. (Per the above assumptions, this would likely be the race of the character’s mother.) Just like usual in character creation, this defines your Racial features, as well as what racially-locked Feats, Techniques, or Spells you might qualify for. Then, select one “Secondary” Race. (This would be your father’s race, per the above.) You may then select up to half (rounded down) of the Primary Race’s Racial features, and replace it with one from the Secondary Race. (If the Primary Race has 3 features – three bullet points – then you may only select and replace one.) . A Note on Minmaxing: Minmax-minded players may be tempted to try and swap a ‘less useful’ Racial feature (such as the Goron ability to eat stone and metals) for a ‘more useful’ feature (such as Rito flight). We strongly encourage the GM to curtail these efforts, and require that features be of at least vaguely equivalent use for a Hero. The goal is to end up with a unique set of features that is no more powerful or numerous than a typical member of that Primary Race. A Note on Flavor: You don’t have to select any features of your Secondary Race if you don’t want to. In that case, having curious parentage is solely a flavor decision, giving you some fluffy aesthetic tweaks. It might still impact your Hero’s background and upbringing, and their outlook on life, even if it doesn’t impact how they function mechanically. You are then encouraged to select a few physical details to inherit from the Secondary Race, to help differentiate yourself from the crowd. This could be eye or hair color, skin or plumage patterns, a size outside the norm of your Primary Race, or any number of other details. ",

    "content": "Isiri is creating a Hero, but wants her to be unique. Having always been enamored with magic and fairies, she decides to make a Fairy Hero – but she also enjoys the idea of avian Heroes, flying, and participating in aerial combat. After talking with her GM, Isiri decides to create a Fairy with the Curious Parentage of a Rito father. Isiri now has a choice for her Fairy Hero: which features to take from the Rito father, and which feature to replace within the Fairy package. Since Fairies have four features, she may replace up to two of them. While any possible combination is tenable, she decides to replace the Fairy flight with Rito flight – making her less capable a flier than other Fairies, but better able to walk and to glide. She also decides that her feathers molt like a Rito’s do, and wants to replace the free Spell that Fairies get – but her GM sees this as being too good a swap. After some discussion, they agree to instead have the molting feathers replace the ability to glow offered by the typical Fairy feature package. Isiri then describes her Fairy Hero, now named Dove – human-sized, lanky, with the wings of a bird instead of the gossamer, insect-like wings of a fairy. Her individual feathers shimmer like glass in the light, though she herself does not cast the gentle glow that other Fairies do. ",

    "content": "Due to their unique package of features, Demons deserve a little extra thought when it comes to inheritance. A Hero cannot inherit a Demon’s ability to transform from a demonic to a mundane visage (or vice-versa), nor can they inherit a Demon’s ability to add half of their Combat or Willpower to the damage they deal. (If you want to use that mechanic, select Demon as your Primary Race.) . However, a Hero might inherit a single feature from one of the Demon’s forms – for instance, demonic wings that enable clumsy flight, or a preternatural Knack for the Flirt, Low Blow, and Predict Maneuvers. When a Demon inherits a feature from a Secondary Race, that feature is available in both their mundane and demonic forms. However, this means that the inherited feature is replacing two features in the Demon package – one from each form. (Typically, these two features should be both sides of the same coin.) For instance, a Demon with a Zora father might always be able to breathe underwater, regardless of their form; however, that Demon might not have the typical To-Hit bonuses against Vitality or Concentration.

    "content": "A Hero with a curious parentage might seek out ways to capitalize on what they’ve inherited, or seek to grow closer to a heritage they feel removed from. A GM may decide to award such a Hero with more ways to tap into their Secondary Race, usually as rewards for quests involving that side of their family tree. This might take the form of granting them a Feat, Technique, or Spell that only someone of their Secondary Race could normally take. Alternatively, it might involve granting them an additional feature from their Secondary Race (or a feature from their Primary Race that they had previously replaced). Racial features should usually be considered worth either 6 or 9 Tokens, depending on the power of the feature in question. (Some very minor ones – those that are mostly flavor – can be considered worth 3 Tokens.) When completing a quest to earn such a feature, as usual, the player should be offered the choice of taking the feature (or the racially-locked Feat, Spell, or Technique), or instead taking the Tokens offered to the other Heroes.

    "content": "Finally, a Hero might have a parentage even more curious than “two mortals from two different Races”. Perhaps they were conceived by a spirit in response to a prayer, sprouted from the fields after planting a dragon’s tooth, were created through a powerful magical Song, or are a demigod begotten from some deity’s mortal dalliances. For such auspicious children, we present a few Racial features that one might use in accordance with the above rules. | You may speak with, and understand, Arcane creatures of Limited intelligence (like spirits, ghosts, and some powerful permanent enchantments). This does not mean they automatically want to speak with you, or that they will tell you the truth. | You gain the Magical Voice Feat for free. In addition, select one Song, which you also know for free. | You gain the Elemental Specialist Feat for free. | . Of course, the above are not the only ways such potent parentage could manifest – you might select an already-existing Racial feature to better demonstrate the curious circumstances of your birth. For instance, a literal “child of the forest” might have the Deku Scrub’s ability to ignore difficult plant-based terrain; or a child born of a demon’s pact might have a Knack for haggling, like a Subrosian.

While many regard the character in this story with suspicion and apprehension, often these lonely souls are just in need of some assistance, and are happy to reward a kind soul! Even still, most people are reasonable to react with aversion when encountering such a being – you can never be too sure if someone you meet in the restroom has practiced proper hygiene. A long arm ending in a clammy hand, these entities seem at least superficially to belong to some manner of humanoid, most apparently a Hylian. They are typically unkempt and unseemly, as they are often willing to get their hand dirty, at least to help others. On the other hand, some appear as well-manicured extremities, respectfully clad in a finely tailored glove or possibly even a rugged gauntlet. In any case, their arm seems uncannily long, and the spaces they emerge from don’t always seem large enough to house the apparent owner of the limb. Despite all efforts, none have seen past the shoulder of one of these folk, the space they emerge from always seeming to be shrouded in obscuring darkness, and attempting to look into the space after they have retreated within always seems to yield either an empty container or a heavily shadowed void. While capable of speech, their voices emit from within the space they are emerging from, and often sound slightly muffled (although usually still understandable) as a result. They are also typically fluent in the use of sign language. While uncommon, these beings possess the uncanny ability to pop up almost anywhere, even in the most surprising places. Typically dwelling within toilets in restrooms, they can – if they choose – emerge from any manner of unexpected opening: the mouth of a jar, the inside of a bag, or an unremarkable hole in the wall. How they get there is unknown, and asking one their method is often met with confusion, as the process seems as mundane to them as walking. An explanation may never be learned. Due to their common need to rely on others for assistance, many of these beings are often humble and grateful, although there are of course those who resort to manipulative tactics and might take advantage of others. In either case, these strange folk rarely allow the chance for a willing friend to slip through their fingers. These folk rarely try their hand at adventuring, especially not solitary adventurers due to their limitations and typically kind personalities. They tend to value exchange and reward handouts in generous ways, placing emphasis on sentimental and personal value over monetary worth. They often need paper, although none know what they do with it, and these entities are always too reluctant to admit. Their tradition is to always reward this gift with something useful, typically with something that fell into the opening they currently occupy. ",

While their abilities would give them a unique advantage in Pickpocketing or Sneak Attacks, these folk rarely resort to such underhanded tactics, although those which specialize in grappling are often regarded as the masters of floors and walls. Despite their obscured hiding space, these folk tend to have an easy time seeing from many other perspectives, and tend to have a good grasp on the situation at hand. They are commonly straightforward and honest, although often exceedingly polite. Typically lonely beings, they do tend to cling to the few friends they can manage to cultivate. They tend to react to confrontation by retreating, preferring to avoid conflict and keep to themselves whenever possible. They are not cowards by any stretch of the word, and are willing to aid those who need a hand. They rarely judge, and often treat disagreements among friends with an even-handed approach. Others often regard an encounter with one of these beings with surprise and fright, although those who give them a chance tend to find them a pleasant individual. Such exchanges often leave common folk feeling unsettled, but the generous rarely leave empty-handed. Many who are willing to grasp the opportunity will often find themselves with a new friend, but many who are disturbed by the encounter find themselves unable to simply let go.

    "content": "Today, we’ve got a quick bit of homebrew, inspired by my players’ actions just the other day: Holiday Lights! . In my Reclaim the Wild campaign, I ran a short sidequest-type adventure, where the players had to save a modern-day town from repeating Christmas every day, caused by an enchanted snowglobe. During that adventure, as the Heroes fled from the roof of a mansion that once held the ensorcelling snowglobe, one of them used a string of electric lights as a makeshift rope to rappel down the manse’s masonry. Both they and I were delighted with this bit of MacGuyver-esque tomfoolery, and the Hero kept the string of lights after the adventure (as well as the other holiday gifts they earned for saving the town). Of course, now that one of my players has a string of lights, I need to decide exactly what they do, and how they work. And if one Hero wants a string of lights, perhaps others will, too – either for their own bungled burglings, or just to decorate their homes and towns. Check ’em out below! . As a note, Holiday Lights are a decidedly technological thing, and may not be well-suited to most Zelda campaign worlds. For instance, while they make sense in a setting like Spirit Tracks, they may feel out of place in a more typical “post-Breath of the Wild” world. If in doubt, discuss with your GM and/or players whether Holiday Lights are appropriate for your game – and if not, maybe decorate trees and windowsills in a more traditional way, using simple Candles! .

These bulbs can be lit when the string is activated, functioning like a lit Candle in every square the string of Holiday Lights occupies. However, these lights cannot be used to start fires, as they do not have an exposed flame. Holiday Lights can only shine while exposed to a suitable source of power, such as a steam engine, a waterwheel, an electrically-enchanted object, or an electrical creature. A small control unit attached to one end of a string of Holiday Lights can be used to turn the lights on, off, or set them to blink in specific patterns. Multiple strings of Holiday Lights may be linked end-to-end, allowing one control unit to manage multiple strings of lights.

New Feat: Pole Vaulter . 3 tokens Effect: When wielding a Long weapon, increase your Athletics (Jumping) score by (Rank / 2) if you are jumping from solid ground (as opposed to water or mid-air jumping). This does not stack if you are wielding multiple Long weapons. New Feat: Snapshot . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Agility 3, Combat 3 Effect: Your Ranged Weapons are now also treated as Melee Weapons while you wield them. You can use Strike and Parry basic attacks with Ranged Weapons, and your 2H Ranged Weapons gain the Sweeping keyword. Optionally, you may expend ammunition with your melee basic attacks (1 per target) to apply their effect to those attacks. New Feat: Spellsword . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Combat 3, Willpower 3 Effect: Your Melee Weapons are now also treated as Arcane Weapons while you wield them. You can use the Spell Volley basic attack and the weapons gain the Wizardly keyword. If your Melee weapon only gains the Wizardly keyword through feats such as this one or Arcane Archer, your spell damage has a -1 penalty with that Melee weapon. New Feat: Thrown Weapon Master . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Agility 3, Accuracy 3 Effect: You can now use Melee weapons with techniques that require Ranged weapons. Melee weapons that have the Returning special quality by default (such as Boomerangs) have their Attack increased by 1. Your Melee weapons gain the Returning special quality. New Feat: Wandslinger . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Agility 3, Combat 3 Effect: You can use your Arcane weapons with techniques that require Ranged weapons. New Spell: Magnesis Warrior . 6 tokens Learn requirement: Magnesis Cost: 4 Magic (Bind) Minor action Effect: While Magic is Bound in this spell, you can use magnetic forces to wield certain weapons – typically Metal – with a few extra benefits. These weapons gain the Hands-Free and Returning qualities. You may also magnetically wield and use metal non-weapon items (such as lockpicks, percussion instruments, metal arrows with Ranged weapons, etc) with this spell, allowing them to float around you. However, you can only wield up to two one-handed items, or one two-handed item. New Technique: Mordhau . 3 tokens Cost: 4 Stamina (Bind) Range: Self Minor action Effect: When you learn this technique, choose one of the following Edge Types: blunt, piercing, sharp. When you use this technique, your melee weapon now deals that type of damage instead of its normal Edge Type. Special: You can buy this technique multiple times. Each time, you can choose an Edge Type you do not already have. If you have multiple versions of this technique, then you can choose which Edge Type you wish to use when you enter it, and you can change it as a minor action. Art by Omega Force, et al . ",

When designing Reclaim the Wild, we intentionally kept Magic regimented and simple. This is, after all, how it is generally used by Link in various Zelda games – he learns specific Spells with specific functions, but he can’t create new magical effects out of thin air. Further, the versions of Hyrule we’ve seen throughout the Zelda games rarely had wizards and sorcerers who practiced flamboyant magic in the town square; even the few other Heroes we see were typically scholars, knights, or otherwise lacking in magical prowess. However, players or GMs might want mages to be able to creatively use magic off-the-cuff, free from the shackles of rote, memorized Spells. Heroes in your game may want to craft small illusions to help tell stories by the campfire, douse the whole party in water to clean off after a particularly messy fight, or want to permanently enchant a door against being opened by evil creatures. For cases like these, we present Improvised Magic. This system should be considered a Master Mode rule – it adds complexity, expanding what magically-inclined players can do. It also adds complexity to the GM’s life, since wizardly Heroes can now invent all kinds of new solutions to the problems and obstacles they’ve concocted. ",

However, Improvised Magic can indirectly cause damage – for instance, if you lit a campfire with an Improvised Spell, and someone stepped into that campfire, they would take damage from that fire. Improvised Magic is capable of causing or removing some Status Ailments, though this is typically considered complex magic, carrying with it a real risk of failure. | Improvised Magic cannot create permanent objects. While an Improvised Spell might be able to conjure a flame, form a snowball, or fill a glass of water, it cannot create a sword or a pencil. Anything created by an Improvised Spell is ephemeral and temporary, and when closely inspected, its results can clearly be seen as magical. | You must know a Spell on which to base your Improvised Magic. Without this grounding in the fundamentals of magic, you lack the knowledge and skill to use Improvised Magic. For instance, if you were to decide to chill a glass of water, you would need to know at least one Spell that had some kind of icy effect – be it a spell like Kotake’s Ice Beam, which causes Ice-type damage, or a spell like Blizzagia’s Breath, which doesn’t cause damage but does have obviously ice-related effects. | Improvised Magic can’t let you ignore other rules.

    "content": "Not all Improvised Spells are simple tasks. Complex or complicated tasks, such as repairing a broken bone, may require additional Magic expenditure – and necessitate a Trait check. When a Hero wishes to perform an Improvised Spell with a complex effect that has a real risk of failure, the GM should determine a DC for that effect. Then, multiply the Improvised Spell’s cost by (DC / 10), to determine its actual cost. The Trait rolled for the Spell depends on how its Magic is utilized, determined previously. | If the Magic is Spent, then use Willpower. | If the Magic is Bound, use Arcana. | If the Magic is Burned, use Enchanting. | . If the Hero fails this check, then the Magic is Spent (regardless of whether it would’ve been Bound, Burned, or Spent on success) and the Improvised Spell’s effect fails to take hold or occur. (The GM is at liberty to allow the Improvised Spell to cause some partial effect, depending on the spell, the circumstances, and the closeness of the roll.) The Hero may or may not be able to try again, depending on the Spell and on the results of their failure. Depending on the nature of the Improvised Spell – particularly if it’s being used on a creature – it may instead be better to model the Spell like an attack. In these cases, decide whether Concentration or Vitality is the better defense against the Spell’s effect, and then proceed with rolling To-Hit that defense per normal. Also depending on the nature of the Spell, you might substitute Arcana, Enchanting, or Willpower in place of Accuracy in the To-Hit roll, at the GM’s discretion. As an aside, you may also decide to modify the cost of Improvised Magic based on its complexity, even if you don’t intend to actually roll a Trait Check or roll To-Hit.

The Triforce is the most powerful object in all the Zelda games. Carrying just a vestige of the power of Hyrule’s creator-goddesses, the Triforce is often sought by fated Heroes as a means to save Hyrule from the most dangerous foes and existential threats. Sometimes it is fragmented, its awesome power split into pieces to prevent its use by those with evil in their heart.

While a Hero is attuned to a Fragment or Aspect of the Triforce, that Fragment resides within that Hero’s soul. This prevents pickpockets or mere happenstance from separating Hero and Fragment. However, sufficiently powerful magic-users might be able to pull a Fragment of the Triforce out of a person by force (see further below). When two people attuned to Fragments or Aspects of the Triforce enter close proximity to one another (within the same room), they’ll become aware of one another’s presence, and that they each carry some portion of the Triforce.

    "title": "Triforce Fragments",
    "content": "In both the original Legend of Zelda and in Wind Waker, a piece of the Triforce has been split into fragments. On their own, each Fragment doesn’t contain the awe-inspiring power that a full piece of the Triforce can bring to bear – making them little more than plot coupons. For players of a tabletop RPG, however, a plot coupon isn’t terribly exciting. They’ll want to utilize the Triforce’s power in some way, however limited it is by being fragmented. And fortunately, we can grant that wish. When a piece of the Triforce is cut up, it shatters into eight Fragments, just as in the original Legend of Zelda. In Reclaim the Wild, each of those eight Triforce Fragments is tied to a specific Trait from that Aspect of the Triforce. For instance, if you find a Fragment of the Triforce of Wisdom, then the Fragment is tied to some specific Wisdom Trait – such as Arcana, Perception, or Influence. This Trait is chosen when the piece of the Triforce is fragmented; the choice is permanent, and there can be no duplicates. While attuned to a Fragment of the Triforce, a Hero gains a single-use Knack for that Fragment’s Trait, which is refreshed when next they take an Extended Rest. However, for those Traits that are rarely rolled and often referenced (such as Combat and Willpower, and possibly Fortitude and Discipline), your GM may decide that being attuned to that Fragment instead grants a single-use +3 bonus to one use of that Trait; as before, this use is refreshed when they next take an Extended Rest. Sourcing Fragments . While it might be tempting to say “oh, Fragments of the Triforce should be at the bottom of a dungeon,” we encourage you to not do this for every Fragment. If your Heroes are tasked with rebuilding the entire Triforce, then that results in having to dive through twenty-four dungeons – which is a lot. Even just the eight Fragments for one Aspect would result in eight dungeons, which is still more than a campaign needs! . Instead, we recommend varying up how Fragments are sourced. Certainly, put some at the bottom of dungeons – it just feels right to explore a forgotten tomb, obtain a Magical Tool, use it to defeat a Boss, and walk away with a shining golden triangle. But you can also have them already being held by others in your world, good or bad, using that Fragment’s power however they feel best. Perhaps a would-be bandit king is using the Triforce Fragment of Intimidation to bring other criminals into his gang; or a village farmer is using the Triforce Fragment of Nature to grow crops more effectively, keeping a village fed in the midst of a famine. Your Heroes may need to solve their problems, and then convince them to part with these tiny pieces of the Goddesses’ own power. Art by Nintendo . ",

Split into Power, Wisdom, and Courage, each Aspect is strongly associated with figures of Hylian legend, and with the Goddesses who created the world of Hyrule. Much like Fragments, a Hero may attune to a whole Aspect of the Triforce. When attuned to an Aspect of the Triforce, the Hero gains a single-use Knack, that they may apply to any Trait check that falls within that Aspect. Unlike with individual Fragments, they may use this Knack once per encounter or scene – allowing them to potentially use it many times per day. (If using the single-use +3 bonus for certain Traits, that use remains valid – and shares the same ‘once per encounter or scene’ cooldown with other uses of that Aspect of the Triforce.) . Remember that there are only three Aspects to the Triforce, and a party of Heroes may number more than three – as such, we do not recommend dealing in full Aspects of the Triforce with larger parties, where some Heroes might be left out from wielding the Triforce’s power.

    "title": "Using the Whole Triforce",
    "content": "Eventually, your Heroes might assemble the whole Triforce from Aspects or Fragments – or perhaps, after a wide gauntlet of trials and challenges, they win their way to the whole Triforce, awaiting them in a mythical, divine hiding place. When the Heroes obtain the Triforce, they gain momentary access to the power of the Goddesses, and may each make a single wish. (For the sake of fairness – and to prevent any Tolkein-esque squabbling over who gets to touch it – this should apply to all the Heroes, even if they don’t all actually touch the Triforce.) . The Triforce will then make their wishes come true. However, the Triforce, despite its omnipotence, is not omniscient – and is not a perfect, infallible wish-granting engine. Limitations on Triforce Wishes . First and foremost, the Triforce is not sentient – rather, its wish-granting is driven by what is held in the heart of whoever makes the wish. If the wisher is good and pure of heart, then so too will the Triforce be as it grants that wish; if the wisher is evil or duplicitous, then so too will the Triforce be. However, it is still bound to the wording of the wish, as interpreted by the wisher’s heart – so careful wording may avoid the worst of possible comeuppances. (This is why it is generally considered a Bad Idea to simply use the Triforce to wish someone dead. While the Golden Power would certainly succeed, it might kill your chosen target in a way you do not like – with lots of collateral damage. It might fail to send their spirit to the afterlife, leaving them free to seek ghostly vengeance. Even if the wish came from a pure-hearted individual with no malice intended, it might even simply set them up to eventually die of natural causes.) . Further, the Triforce’s reality-rewriting power has its own limitations. It can change the world, alter peoples’ bodies, and even revive the dead – but it cannot rewrite history, or alter peoples’ minds. If someone wished themselves King of Hyrule, then the castle’s edifice would change to their liking, their portrait would hang in the halls, the old King would be left a pauper on the street… but everyone would remember how things were, and the Triforce would do little to guarantee the loyalty of the newfound king’s court (or army). Usurpers who use the Golden Power to grant their wish would do well to have other means of keeping what they’ve gotten. (Some scholars theorize that this lack of temporal and mind-altering ability is somehow related to the triangular hole in the middle of the Triforce, and how the Triforce lacks representation from the mysterious Goddess of Time. Such theories are fun to discuss over tea and crumpets, but the truth might never be known – unless, of course, a scholar were to touch those shining relics themselves, and make a wish.) . Further, any one wish made by the Triforce can only affect a single world at a time, and the Triforce must be within that world (or reasonably near to it, metaphysically speaking) at the time with wish is made. For instance, wishing to “conquer everything” while standing in the Dark World might result in you gaining the allegiance of an unstoppable horde of mindlessly loyal undead soldiers, but only within the Dark World – your wish would not echo far enough to affect the Light World, the Twilight Realm, or other worlds beyond. If you wanted to then conquer the Light World in the same way, you’d need to somehow move the Triforce there – and not allow anyone else a chance to make a wish on it, of course. That said, nothing stops you from creating a whole new world with a wish, split from or copied off of whatever world you so happen to be standing in. Finally, once someone has made a wish, they cannot make another wish upon the Triforce for a year and a day afterwards. However, that limitation only stops that individual from making a wish: anyone else who touches the Triforce can make a wish, no matter how little time has passed since the prior wish. This often leads to the current owner of the Triforce locking it away – typically in a grandly-appointed (but hard to reach and enter) temple, palace, or dungeon. Art by Nintendo . ",

    "content": "As the Triforce serves as the ultimate goal of so many Zelda games, we strongly suggest that you follow suit, and look to winding your game’s story up after the Heroes obtain the Triforce. There’s not many ways to escalate the stakes much further after that. That said, it could be interesting to explore the consequences of whatever wishes your Heroes make upon the Triforce. Perhaps they turned out well, or poorly, or in ways wholly unintended and unpredictable. Perhaps one day, a new generation of Heroes would need to come and claim the Triforce’s power from them, to stop some new threat – or end the threat that the old Heroes and their wishes represent. Or, perhaps your Heroes can deal with the consequences of now owning the Triforce, and how they need to protect it from others’ hands. Will they build a Castle and house it within its depths? Carve it up and scatter it, placing each Fragment at the bottom of a dungeon and installing a ferocious creature to guard it? Or will they place it back within the Sacred Land, and then sing powerful Magical Songs to seal it away? And, of course, will there be any other forces – evil, greedy, or even righteous! – who might seek to stop them, to claim the Triforce’s power before it escapes their potential grasp? . Finally, there is the question of destroying the Triforce (likely by wishing upon it to do so, as little else could damage this artifact of the world’s creation). This is the only sure-fire way to keep it out of evil hands… but it should not be undertaken lightly. As the Triforce contains a portion of the Goddesses’ power, destroying it is really destroying a part of all creation; in turn, all of creation itself might crumble away to nothingness, as seen in A Link Between Worlds. Further, it is akin to destroying a part of the Goddesses themselves – and they may not take kindly to such an affront. Perhaps it would even lure them back to the world, seeking to directly confront whoever would scorn them so. ",

In the end, that is the promise of Reclaim the Wild; by introducing the Triforce, we – and, we hope, you – can help fulfill that promise in one more awesome way. ",

    "content": "Inklings are short humanoids, whose most notable feature is the tentacles atop their scalp. The length of these tentacles can vary, reaching as far down as an Inkling’s knee. Though these tentacles do not actually serve as useful limbs, and an Inkling can only barely feel anything through them. However, they’re still quite dear to an Inkling as an expression of their personality and style: Inklings will sometimes wrap, curl, bind, or even cut their tentacles in much the same way that other races would style their hair. (Cut Inkling tentacles will regrow, albeit more slowly than hair.) These tentacles can even change color at the Inkling’s whim, influencing the color of Ink they produce. Beyond their tentacles, Inklings have a few other features that immediately distinguish them from Hylians. For one, an Inkling’s eyes are surrounded by black markings, much like a raccoon’s. The teeth in their mouth are pointed and sharp, with two large canines on top and one on the bottom, giving many Inklings a mischievous, toothy grin. Their ears are flat and pointed, like a wider, shorter version of a Hylian’s ears. Inklings are capable of producing copious amounts of Ink, much like a common squid. An Inkling’s Ink is a colorful, sticky goop, matching the hue of their tentacles in that moment. Inklings use their Ink to sign their names, paint graffiti on buildings, mark their territory, or most famously, to cause damage and chaos in combat. Inklings hail from dense, urban cities, founded on small islands or atolls. There, land is scarce, valuable, and often fought over. Inklings have had a number of ‘Turf Wars’ over their history, defending their homes from species that would rise from the sea to claim it as their own. ",

    "content": "Moreso than most, Inklings like to showcase their own personal stylings: an Inkling’s fashion choices speak to their mood, goals, and identity. In Inkling society, being ‘fresh’ (that is, being both unique and true to oneself) is the highest compliment. Inklings are quick to defend territory that they see as ‘theirs’, whether this is actual land, personal property, a philosophical stance, or their fashion choices. Woe betide the fool who decides to encroach on an Inkling’s domain, for they’ll quickly find themselves coated in ink, or worse. In combat, Inklings often prefer to use attacks that hit as much area as they can, to both claim the territory as their own and to inflict pain on their enemies. To that end, two-handed melee weapons, as well as ranged weapons, are often their most preferred kit. To take advantage of their natural evasiveness while in Ink-Daubed territory, many Inkling Heroes prefer to wear Light Armor, or even Civilian gear, prioritizing fresh fashion and speed over defense. Characteristics: Active, Competitive, Fun-Loving, Hip, Playful, Stylish, Territorial .

When you take damage from an attack while Stained, after the attack resolves, your attacker may choose to consume your Stained status. If they do, you take (Rank of the Weapon you’re being struck by / 2) additional damage, unmodified by Defense, and your Stained status ends. If an attack consumes your Stained status, it cannot also Stain you. You can end your Stained status with a Standard Action.

Ink-Daubed: Ink-Daubed Terrain is Difficult Terrain for its creator’s enemies, but not for its creator or any allies of its creator. (Ink-Daubed Terrain created by a neutral party is Difficult Terrain for everyone.) When you fall Prone in Ink-Daubed Terrain, you become Stained.

    "content": "Over the past year-and-some-change of developing Reclaim the Wild, I’ve run a number of one-shots and short campaigns. And while treasure, the fate of the world, or a hearty ‘thanks’ can be enough motivation to get Heroes moving, those might not be very rewarding when you know the game won’t last a long time – and you can get all of those playing other tabletop RPGs, anyway. But there’s one prize that feels incredibly unique to Zelda games, and really makes players sit up and pay attention: giving them a Fairy Friend. Fairy Friends aren’t just a useful Feat, granting you a small bonus on To-Hit rolls. They also provide the GM a voice in interplayer conversations, and a conduit for players to ask in-character questions about the world they see without sounding strange. Further, the Fairy Friend’s potential to change into one of half a dozen colors, each with their own benefits, gives players a unique way to express their character, by choosing the color that’s right for them. So one of the first pieces of advice I’d give to prospective Reclaim the Wild GMs, is to think of a way for their players to earn a Fairy Friend. Here are some options, from past games I’ve run: . | To prevent her from interfering with the evil warlock Karnyx’s plans, the Great Fairy Neirin has been sundered, her essence split into lesser Stray Fairies. Those Stray Fairies were then hidden throughout the land, entrusted to some of Karnyx’s most powerful minions. To revive Neirin and gain a powerful ally against Karnyx, the Heroes will need to find these Stray Fairies – and as they do, the individual Stray Fairies, each representing an aspect of Neirin’s spirit, can serve as a Hero’s Fairy Friend. | Three hundred years ago, a group of Heroes set out to prevent Calamity Ganon’s resurrection – and failed. They left behind few traces of their journey, but a few souls still remember them: their Fairy Friends. Still heartbroken over the failed quest, these unfortunate Fairies could yet prove a boon to the Heroes of today: if they can be convinced to join the Heroes, they can provide invaluable information about the long-forgotten travels and travails of those forgotten Heroes of yore. | Not all Fairies are above the fray of mortal machinations. When the Heroes visit the secluded kingdom of Ikana, they soon find themselves in the presence of the Great Fairy Shayal, who freely gifts them Fairy Friends to help them on their quests. However, Shayal has more in mind than simply helping itinerant adventurers: these Fairy Friends are her spies, her eyes and ears. Riding under a Hero’s cap, they can freely travel between nations, observe the actions of mortals, and report anything of interest back to Shayal. They may even influence the Heroes to Shayal’s own ends, turning them into her unwitting agents with only a few suggestions from their trusted voices. | . ",

Magical Masks are a special kind of Magical Tool. They are all One-Handed Wooden tools that can be put on, or removed, as a Standard Action. Once put on, they do not occupy any equipment slot. However, you can only have one Magical Mask equipped at any time. While worn, you receive the special effect of the mask. When using this homebrew, count “Mask of the Healed Soul” (Reclaim the Wild, page 199) as a Magical Mask. ",

    "content": "All-Night Mask . Effect: You cannot become sleepy or tired, and magical forces prevent you from lying down for long. While you are Prone, you may stand up as a Reaction to being targeted by an attack (halving your Movement during your next turn). You may combine this with any other Reaction that require being targeted by an attack. Blast Mask . Effect: As a Standard Action, you may activate this worn mask to produce the explosion of a normal Bomb, with you at the center of the Blast. You may spend 4 Magic to produce the explosion of any Bomb that costs 40 Rupees, spend 12 Magic to produce the explosion of a Super Bomb, or spend 20 Magic to produce the explosion of a Powder Keg at the end of the third turn after activating this effect. Special: The mask is immune to the damage and effects of its own explosions, including Brushfire terrain produced by a Brushfire Bomb’s explosion. Bunny Hood . Effect: While wearing the mask, you gain Hasty 2 and you treat your Athletics Rank as 2 higher if you are Jumping. These effects only apply for running on the ground and you cannot Sneak while wearing the mask. Couple’s Mask . Effect: You can use Rebonak’s Retort and Ravio’s Hookshot for free and even if you haven’t learned either, but if you do, you must target your Partner (see Special). Special: This can only be created by fusing a “Sun Mask” and a “Moon Mask”, and you must hold one mask while another character holds the other mask. The other character will become your Partner. You and your Partner can only have a Couple’s Mask they created in their inventory; holding a second Couple’s Mask or trying to put it in your inventory instead drops that mask on an adjacent space. You or your partner may choose to permanently destroy the shared Couple’s Mask to be able to carry a foreign Couple’s Mask. Giant’s Mask . Effect: While wearing it, your size in feet triples (usually making you two size categories larger) and you cannot be affected by other size-changing effects, including Minish Minuet. As long as you wear it, you must Burn 2 Magic immediately after starting to wear it, and at the beginning of each of your turns. If you can’t pay the cost, the mask falls off your face and drops into an adjacent space before you shrink back to your normal size. Mask of Scents . Effect: You have a Knack for all rolls based on locating and identifying smells and scents. This includes surveying for Critters, Food and Monsters. Due to the mask making it hard to speak while wearing it and forcing you into a more feral posture, you suffer a -2 penalty to any rolls based on social interaction (including haggling). Mask of Truth . Effect: You can cast Lens of Truth even if you haven’t learned it and you may choose to use either Stamina or Magic to pay the cost. While wearing it, treat three overlapping sources of Fair Light as Bright Light. Stone Mask . Effect: You are Invisible while wearing the mask. This counts as a magical illusion. If anyone within line of sight is capable of seeing through your Invisibility, you become Slowed and cannot remove the mask until you are out of sight. ",

Reclaim the Wild intends for players to play all-new Heroes, rather than rehashing Link and his adventures. However, the time might come when you want to have the Master Sword show up in your game. Perhaps Link himself makes an appearance, and needs your Heroes’ help to accomplish a task and save the day. Alternatively, perhaps Link died, or was never born – and hitherto-unknown Heroes must now take up the Master Sword and do what needs be done. Famously, the Master Sword is rarely the most powerful sword Link wields.

Their skin has a natural luster to it, and those who take painstaking care of their skin can achieve a highly reflective finish. Ore-ons do not have hair, per se, but they develop outcroppings of metal on their chin, brow, back, and scalp as they enter adulthood. These outcroppings are usually silver or bronze, and tarnish with age. In some rare cases the the outcroppings are gold in color. They are taller and heavier in weight than their mountain brethren. They are still recognizable by their potbellies and chestnut-shaped heads. Traveling Ore-on often need to be wary of their weight.

During a Short Rest, two nearby characters who are at least neutral to each other (including heroes) may fuse a Kinstone. To do so, both characters must use a Kinstone of a matching colour. Doing so fills the fusing characters with a feeling of happiness and camaraderie toward the other.

The lands of Hyrule are partially covered in the blessings of Guardian Deities, powerful servants of the Golden Goddesses and the lands themselves, protecting the settlement or landmark assigned to them and making sure its inhabitants will always have enough resources to ensure a peaceful day-by-day life. But sometimes, the forces of evil challenge a Guardian Deity’s sanctuary. And sometimes, those forces are too much for them, leaving them with no choice but either to retreat or, more commonly, to relinquish their immortality to greatly boost their blessing one last time, hoping that a hero shall appear and drive evil away before the blessing wanes. Most Minor Deities are created when a Guardian Deity sacrifices themselves. Their fleeting essence is split up in multiple pieces before those fragments create shells resembling members of the mortal races. Each fragment retains a part of the Guardian Deities’ memories and knowledge, although not much of their powers. As those Minor Deities travel the world in search for a hero or for something that can help the land they blessed, their powers grow, but they also develop individual personalities. Some Minor Deities are even capable of going against the will of the original Guardian Deity (although very rarely to the point they ally with the forces of evil). For the most part though, one Minor Deity will eventually rise above the others and reach a threshold where the fragments of the other related Minor Deities vanishes from their bodies. That one Minor Deity will return to their homeplace and be reborn as the new Guardian Deity while the other Minor Deities, now without essence, become just like regular mortals sans the ability to procreate. In more unusual cases, a living Guardian Deity implants a part of their power into their most loyal servant as part of an important mission said servant must undergo. While they would never call themselves that, those are Minor Deities too. Once the important mission has been accomplished, the servants get to keep that part of the Guardian Deities’ power as a blessing and may even become unique Guardian Deities themselves if desired. However, few servants pursue that possibility. The rarest of Minor Deities are formed spontaneously out of nothing. This usually happens when a new settlement is built that needs protection or when those Minor Deities born out of a Guardian Deities’ sacrifice fail to become the Guardian Deities’ rebirth, either because their personalities clash with the rebirth or because they have been successfully hunted by the forces of evil. Playing a Minor Deity . Depending on how they came to be, Minor Deities initially tend to be either knowledgable but distant and cold or naive but curious. As they develop a personality, they become as multi-faceted as the mortal races. An exception are servants-made-Deities, since they already had a personality before. Gaining more knowledge about their own powers and their fate as a potential new Guardian Deity, paired with the eventual realization that they will outlive their friends and loved ones they may make on their travel, is an integral part of a Minor Deities’ existence. This can temper their will to fulfill their destiny further or make them want to give up on their supernatural heritage and seek to be as mortal as their surroundings. While a Minor Deity can indeed reject their essence, this should be reserved for the end of the campaign. No matter if they lose their essence or make their final steps towards becoming a Guardian Deity, expect a bittersweet ending for that character’s career and for the group as a whole either way. When adventuring, Minor Deities can use their inherent ability to traverse difficult landmarks and perform songs inherent to them to help their group in a myriad of ways, even if the group already has a bard. Due to their commitment to traits from their chosen Aspect, they can cover a wide area of expertises and always perform decently in combat, dungeoneering, social challenges, knowledge challenges and crafting as long as it fits their niche. Of course, that means they will always underperform outside of their chosen Aspect, so a Power Servant will not always hit, a Wisdom Servant will not always activate additional effects of Spells and a Courage Servant, while hitting a lot more often, will not deal as much damage. In other words, Minor Deities can both be the backbone of a group and a hindrance if they are forced to perform well with traits outside of their Aspect. In addition, a Minor Deity can tap into the bonuses of both being a Minor Deity and their chosen race, which, combined with being the before-mentioned backbone of a group, makes them surprisingly flexible in unique ways. Lastly, remember that a Minor Deity has a strong tie to a specific settlement or location, so whenever the group visits it, you can expect to be able to get a wide variety of assistance because its inhabitants already know the character well and tend to like them. Characteristics: Introspective, Mystical, Friendly, Exalted, Distanced, Unsure, Pondering, Self-conflicted . Minor Deity Names usually take one of the more common names of the race they imitate to not attract unwanted attention. They would never give themselves a name based on the Guardian Deity whose essence they inherited, as they see said name as a title to earn. Names: See template race’s entry. ",

Their buildings are usually wooden and built on stilts, so they are above the swampy mud. They enjoy a variety of foods that other races would not even consider touching. Monster parts are often incorporated into meals, and often pickled. These pickled monster parts, along with durians, and other pungent foods, are considered delicacies and have a high trade value to the Mire Zora. They share a great deal of hospitality to those who would visit and love to cook for guests and entertain. They know other races aren’t as culinarily inclined and substitute the monster parts they enjoy for some less intense flavors when cooking for other races. ",

    "content": "This new set of weapons exist to suit those who want to play certain styles of characters that, sadly, are not reflected in Reclaim the Wild’s Core Rulebook, or even further expand on other styles. Helmet weapons are specialized head gear that will let you headbutt your way to victory, and they don’t replace your Head Armor for that! If your group has a Goron that only trusts his fists and feet, tell them that you can also use your head to win a battle! . Tonfas are cane-like weapons wielded by putting them attached to your arms, grabbing them by a little spot that allows so. They are sturdy weapons, known for being the cause of many broken bones. Nunchaku consist of two little, cane-like, sturdy sticks tied together by a rope or a chain. They are useful tools that can be used in a wide variety of scenarios, and little kids like to mess with them, moving them around like crazy and eventually hitting their own faces. Be wary! . A Flying Sword is, well, a sword that flies! These magically-enhanced weapons are tied to their user, who controls them with brain work and hand commands, like an orchestra conductor with an invisible baton commanding a sharp band. While you may think that a Flying Sword is befitting of the Hands-Free Keyword, truth is, it takes a big amount of focus for the “conductor” to maintain the blade floating with their commands. Dual Blades are, simply put, two short swords put together, with each edge at each side. Nothing much to be said here. A Bladebow is a sort of switchblade attached to the superior part of your wrist with a crossbow wire included over it. Keeping a firm grip on it, and also a finger on the crossbow part’s trigger!, is highly important at all times. Finally, Brushes are what painters use to draw, but of the size of a short sword, or even a spear! These magical artifacts cast and use paint in order to canalize spells, as well as to taint the world of your color of choice! . ",

Note 1, Seed Shooter: The listed Edge type typically applies when using Techniques that do not rely on basic attacks. Under Master Mode rules, Seed Shooters use Seeds as ammunition instead of Arrows (see Expand Your Armory). Note 2, Sheikah Combat Wires: Comes with a pair of gloves, a “wire” glove and a “hook” glove. The hook glove pulls one or multiple strings of sharp steel out of the wire glove, the latter can retract the wires via thumb button press. The wires can be used as a garrote or like a bladed whip, using the hook glove to fixate the garrote or manipulate the wires mid-swing. Note 3: Artillery weapons consume Cannonballs instead of Arrows when using the Shoot Arrow action, ignoring the Cannonball’s base damage (see Rebuild the Wild, Page 38). When attacking, add (Cannonball’s Rank / 2, rounded up) to the weapon’s ATK. Note 4: Lunging weapons are made for incredible agility and quickly stepping in and out to extend one’s striking range. As part of an Attack or Technique using the Lunging weapon, you may spend 1 Stamina to move 1 square and then resolve the Attack or Technique. After resolving it, you move 1 square in the opposite direction of the first move. Entering these squares costs no movement. To perform the Lunging, you must not enter difficult terrain for both the first and the second time you move 1 square by this effect. Note 5: Weighted weapons are made for throwing, having been prepared in such a way that they can be easily accessed. Weighted Weapons have +3 ATK when thrown and immediately after an action that involved throwing Weighted weapons, you may move an item from your belt or a Weighted weapon from your pack into your empty hand(s) as a free action. Weighted Weapons are a prime candidate for adding the Throw Only keyword. Throw Only weapons have been made exclusively for fire-and-forget purposes. They have half their Market value than normal for their Rank, but they only have half as much Duration and using such a weapon for anything but the Throw Weapon Basic Attack and Techniques that require a Thrown Weapon will make it take Durability damage equal to its Durability after the action has been resolved.

    "content": "Nopons are small, furry beings that, naturally, inhabit villages in forests, although it is not unusual to see them everywhere else. At first, these balls of fluff might seem intellectually undeveloped, ignoring many elements and constructions in their sentences when speaking. However, they are by no means not smart; in fact, they are cunning and persuasive. Nopons are small and have fur all over their bodies, except in the belly area. They are somewhat round, although many people have referred to them as “talking potatoes”. Nopons have six limbs: four thin ones that serve as legs and arms, with their respective little paws, and two bigger ones that resemble some kind of wings growing out from just below the back of their necks, which they use to carry most things thanks to their hand-like ends. All of these physical characteristics allow them to hide with ease, flee from predators in many ways, and even flutter a bit with their wings. Nopons live throughout the whole world. Not even a volcano is a place tough enough for a Nopon if living there means making profit. Even so, their preferred and natural environment are forests, where they form great communities and build their structures, always respecting the natural environment. If you suddenly find yourself within Nopon territory, fear not, a charming welcoming is coming your way. Their ways might be different from those of other intelligent species, but that’s because all of their needs are always covered in their communities, so Nopon merely develop their societies using what they have at their disposal, rarely creating great, mechanical inventions.

    "content": "Nopons are simple-minded, but they are also greedy and selfish when it comes to business. They enjoy living with other people and respect social order, however. These attitudes combined drive Nopons towards a very specific profession in life: commerce. The great majority of Nopon are interested in making money for themselves or their families, but there are lots who would prefer to take on other needed professions, becoming doctors, chefs or teachers. All Nopons see a friend in every intelligent race, and will express that friendship at any moment, calling whatever person whose name they do not know yet “friend”. They are also respectful for foreign traditions and cultures, as well as wallets. If you do something for a Nopon, you will get something in exchange, although it typically won’t be worth the effort and you’ll just get scammed. All and all, whatever a Nopon is doing, they will always think that it helps for the greater good, whether that’s actually true or not. Nopons are also known for their empathy towards animals, being able to understand their body language and communicate back. With this great ability, Nopons make up for what they lack by taming creatures that can help them. Their simple minds are also a key factor of their personae; they sometimes won’t appreciate the true worth of something, and other times they will over-value it. For this reason, if a Nopon is giving you a heartfelt gift, accept it no matter what it is, your Nopon friend might think of it as something of great, great value when it actually is worth nothing in your society. Nopon heroes will often prefer carrying a light weight over wielding great equipment. This way, when it’s time to high-tail it out of battle, they can be the first ones to be out of harm’s way. Some might be brave enough to defy the odds and take on the danger head-on, in hopes of succeeding and creating their own legend within their poor, defenseless Nopon folk back home. In the end, all a Nopon wants is success. Characteristics: Simple-minded, Greedy, Respectful, Fearful, Adventurous, Sociable . Nopon names are simple, easy to pronounce, with very few syllables and rarely having more than one consonant and vowel per syllable. Female names: Bokubo, Bonoga, Dindi, Lakire, Milaki, Mindi, Oka, Reki, Tasu . Male names: Abogo, Bokoko, Dunga, Fufuko, Lekue, Mana, Riki, Tora, Zanba . ",

    "content": "Nopons express themselves verbally in a unique way. While they speak the language spoken in the land they live in, they find it quite difficult to properly follow all the rules of a given language. As such, Nopons continuously omit elements such as prepositions, use the different forms of personal pronouns incorrectly, use the infinitive form of a verb for most situations, and sometimes even turn the order of the words upside-down. This way of speaking is deeply established in Nopon settlements, making them believe that when someone speaks “correctly”, that someone is actually speaking in a strange, unique way. This language barrier does not hinder communication with a Nopon, however; in the end, both you and your furry friend are speaking the same language. When it comes to naming things, Nopons don’t bother making complicated names. The name of a given thing might simply be a word or two that describe the way they think about it, or even adding a cool-sounding (at least for them) adjective after a more general noun. Other time, however, they might simply say “pon” after the widespread name of the item in question. “Pon” is a signature word of their language. The closest thing to it in other hyrulean cultures is the “Goro” from Gorons. “Pon” on itself bears no meaning, it can be used in a variety of ways; a Nopon might express joy by screaming “Pon!”, or might call a Hylian a “Hylia pon”. “Pon” is also used to refer to family relatives: mamapon, papapon, unclepon, minipon for children, littlepon for one’s children, etc.. Lastly, to refer to themselves, Nopons will, most of the time, use their names instead of pronouns, maybe in an attempt of reinforcing their presence and importance. ",

While the Rebuild the Wild supplement offers a variety of new Buildings and Amenities for Heroes to outfit their towns with, there’s one critical piece of Zelda architecture that it’s been missing: the Pedestal. Pedestals have been a part of Zelda lore since Link to the Past placed their hallowed new creation, the Master Sword, on one. Since then, Pedestals have served a variety of magical purposes: protecting and sealing artifacts of immense power, acting as focal points for potent Magical Songs, or serving as a lock to be opened by some key object. Until now, Heroes have been unable to create their own Pedestals. With this new Building type, though, you can now cement your own legends for future generations. Check it out below! . ",

    "title": "New Building: Pedestal",
    "content": "Art by Nintendo . Required Materials: . | 5 Gems | 10 Monster Parts | 15 Ancient Materials | . Song Focus . This Pedestal serves as the focus for a particular Magical Song. While the effect may vary depending on exactly which Song is used, there are a few common threads that bind these types of Pedestals. Note that a Pedestal may only be bound to a single Song, and to a single purpose, and that these choices are permanent. Altering the Song: While standing on this Pedestal, the Song bound to the Pedestal can work in subtly different ways. These effects can be drastically different from what the Song can normally accomplish, but must still relate to the Song’s original purpose in some way. Perhaps the Song of Birds will summon a huge Roc to carry the Heroes to the Sky Temple; or the Song of Command will cause fallen pillars to right themselves, opening a path forward to an ancient tomb. Whatever the effect, it is transitory – should you play the Song elsewhere, it will only have its usual effects. Boosting the Song: While standing on this Pedestal, any Hero who plays the appropriate Song may consider their Perform Trait to be increased by (Pedestal’s Rank) for the purposes of that Song, including for calculating their Musical Power. Note that this can go above usual maximums, which can result in some truly world-shaking musical effects – be sure to work with your GM when determining what your boosted Song accomplishes. Teaching the Song: With the addition of a Sign (or other means) to communicate the particulars of the Song, then anyone who stands on the Pedestal and understands the Sign may learn the Song, without any cost or concern. Even the most tone-deaf Hero can pick up the Song with just a few minutes of practice. (This is most commonly done with the Song of Return, teaching a Song that will return a Hero directly to the Pedestal on which they learned the Song.) . Protected Space . The Pedestal serves as a special, protected space. When creating the Pedestal, specify what people must do to be able to stand on the Pedestal. This may be a complex task, such as “collect three Pendants of Virtue”; or it may be simple and easily achieved, such as “receive the Village Elder’s blessing”. However, the requirement must be based on a person’s actions, not their origins. Anyone who fulfills the Pedestal’s conditions may freely step atop the Pedestal. While on the Pedestal, they are protected from all things outside the Pedestal. Weather effects are reduced by (Pedestal’s Rank), and you may add (Pedestal’s Rank) to your Concentration, Defense, Evasion, and Vitality against any attacks originating from outside the Pedestal’s bounds. Anyone who does not fulfill the Pedestal’s conditions will feel a sense of foreboding and ill-ease when approaching the Pedestal, warning them away. Should they ignore these warnings, any Monsters of a Rank less than (Pedestal’s Rank) will find themselves utterly unable to set foot on the Pedestal – as if running into an invisible wall. Creatures of a Rank greater or equal to the Pedestal’s will find themselves Slowed, and will suffer (Pedestal’s Rank) damage at the end of every turn, ignoring Defense. Weapon Spirit’s Home . This Pedestal serves as the home of a particular Weapon Spirit. The Pedestal must be at least the same Rank as the Weapon Spirit’s Weapon to serve as its home. The Weapon Spirit must be serving you at the time of the Pedestal’s creation, and must agree to make the Pedestal its home. When the Weapon Spirit’s Weapon is placed upon the Pedestal, the Spirit enters a deep slumber. During this time, the Weapon Spirit cannot communicate, but it can sense those who stand on its Pedestal – who they are, what they carry, anything they speak aloud, and their intentions. While slumbering, the Weapon Spirit will slowly rejuvenate itself from even the most grievous injury. This even speeds its recovery from more mundane dents and dings: the Durability of the Weapon the Spirit inhabits will recover an additional (Pedestal’s Rank) Durability each night. In addition, while slumbering, the Weapon Spirit can refuse to be drawn by anyone, for any reason it likes. No force in Hyrule can move the weapon against its will, save perhaps for the Goddesses themselves. ",

    "title": "Phonograph Core v2.01",
    "content": "Phonographs are a minor staple of the Zelda franchise, and serve as a useful shorthand for showcasing how technologically advanced a Zelda game world is: the more advanced their record-playing technology, the more advanced the world itself is. Appearing in Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, Oracle of Seasons, and The Minish Cap, Phonographs have been used to teach Link the notes for Magical Songs, to entertain visiting guests, and to serve as a relaxing way to pass the time with some nice tunes. In Reclaim the Wild, Heroes are sure to find clever uses for Phonographs above and beyond these. Perhaps they’ll secretly record a corrupt noble’s meeting with a dark wizard, or play a recording of themselves shouting and cavorting to distract a guard while they slip into a fortress. Below, for use in your own Reclaim the Wild games, we present a new Mundane Tool, the Phonograph, and its Ammunition, Discs. Art by Sweet Clip Art . Phonograph: (Wood) A device that records and produces sound. A Phonograph might be cranked by hand, powered by a hand-wound spring, or they might be powered by an internal mechanism (such as a magical gem, electricity, or powered by wind or water), depending on the technology level of your game’s world. Phonographs play Discs; without a Disc to play, the Phonograph makes only white noise. A Phonograph’s maximum volume is dependent on its Rank. It can be clearly heard in either a Burst (2+(Rank/2)), or a Cone (5+Rank), and faintly heard at twice those distances. Phonographs can play music while carried; this requires two hands, and Slows the carrying creature. Disc: (Monster Parts) Discs are blank until they’re recorded on, using a Phonograph. Once they’ve been recorded on, a Disc cannot be re-used for recording. However, once recorded, a Disc can be played repeatedly. A single Disc can record up to 5 minutes of speech, music, or other audio. A Disc only requires 2 Monster Parts to craft. Depending on the Rank of Monster Parts used, you can create multiple Discs. Treat this like crafting normal Bombs, using the same chart and rules as in the “Crafting Bombs” section of the Core Rulebook. Most Discs have a Market Price of 20 Rupees, whether or not they are blank, but some valuable or rare recordings may be worth more. Discs go in the Ammunition pouch of your Pack, and are considered Ammunition for Phonographs. Discs do not stack with one another, unless they are of the same recording. Phonographs and Magical Songs: While Discs can record mundane music with high fidelity, they cannot duplicate the arcane power of Magical Songs. When a Magical Song is played from a Disc, it does not produce any magical effects. However, a skilled Performer may be able to learn a Magical Song by listening to a Disc of it; consult your GM. ",

    "title": "Queen’s Cane Core v2.01",
    "content": "One of the most fun parts of a Zelda game is finding the cool new Magical Tools you’ll use to solve puzzles and navigate the world. And of course, tabletop game players love finding new items – and using them to circumvent the GM’s plans. In posts like these, we want to share Magical Tools made for Reclaim the Wild games. And the first one we want to share is a totally original item, the Queen’s Cane! . Queen’s Cane . Magical Tool - One-Handed - Wooden . By tapping the tip of this wooden cane against a surface (including your open hand), you can create fresh beeswax. It was originally used to help build this hive, and was then used to seal individual honeycombs or otherwise perform ceremonial bee-duties. Cost: 1 Stamina (Bind or Burn) Range: Self Effect: You create or destroy a single dollop of beeswax, up to 1 cubic square. Created wax persists until your next Short or Extended Rest. This can be used in a number of ways, limited only by your creativity. Some possibilities include: . | (Bind) Seal an opening (up to 1 sq. in size) with thick, hard wax. This seal is water-tight, but is not heat resistant (it will hold back water, but not lava). The wax is sufficiently sturdy to support a person’s weight. A wax-sealed square can be broken through with a test of Athletics v. the cane-user’s Arcana, or upon contact with any Fire attack or fire source. If the wax is destroyed, the Bound Stamina is Burned. | (Burn) Create a single Candle or bar of Soap. Items created this way last until your next Short or Extended Rest. The item is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. | (Burn) Seal a letter, Bottle, or package with a crest or sigil of your devising. This seal persists until the object is opened. (The seal doesn’t prevent anyone from opening the item, but may reveal if it was tampered with.) | (Bind) Coat a single object in a thin layer of wax. This functions somewhat like using Oil on a piece of equipment, preventing (but not removing) Rust, or lubricating the moving parts of a machine. This wax coating persists until your next Short or Extended Rest. | . The Queen’s Cane is a perfect item to put in a tree- or bee-themed dungeon. While it doesn’t provide any combat utility, it gives clever players lots of ways to solve puzzles and overcome challenges. They can clog up pipes, unseal honeycombs, or even create small platforms. However, the Queen’s Cane could also be in the hands of a noble, using it to affix – and alter – the wax seals on their correspondence. They could also use it to seal bottles of wine, or poison, without touching the object in question. Finally, since the wax from the cane can be used as a lubricant for moving parts, anyone interested in large-scale machinery might want to get their hands on this Magical Tool, if only to save a few Rupees on bulk Oil orders.

    "content": "6 tokens Learn requirement: GM Approval Cost: 3 Stamina (Bind) Minor action Effect: All Melee Weapons gain the Extending quality, including your Bare Hand. Weapons that are Extending by default deal 1 Extra Damage. This technique forms the core of the fighting style in the sport of ARMS. With it you can make melee attacks and Combat Maneuvers like Grapple at a range, using any weapon you like. Activating ARMed and Dangerous may involve putting on the mask required to properly control the ARMS in spiral form. Who should get ARMS? . This is a decision ultimately up to the GM, but here are some ideas: . Anyone: the simplest option, this basically ignores what little lore exists and just allows anyone with the tokens to gain the technique. Only those from the ARMS world: in a game where the various Nintendo settings are separate and meet together – such as in Super Smash Brothers – it may seem best to only allow those from the ARMS world to get the ability. This may be accompanied with various other differences that may provide advantages and disadvantages to each setting. For instance, those from ARMS, Metroid, F-Zero, and Star Fox worlds may know how to drive cars and use computers, while those from a Zelda world may not. Though, unique people from non-ARMS worlds, such as Lanky Kong, may also be able to take the technique. Some people: Though the lore behind the ARMS phenomena is scant, it does provide some basis for selectively allowing certain races to take the technique. Animals and plants gain the gifts, while machines can simply have springlike equipment. In addition, there is Helix, an artificial person that seems to resemble the ooze/slime types of creature that show up in Zelda as chuchus, gels, and zols. The following races may be eligible to receive ARMS on the basis of being an animal, machine, plant, or otherwise thematically appropriate: Acheman, Bob-omb, Deku Scrub, Gerudo, Hylian, Inkling, Keaton, Rito, Sheikah, Talking Animal, Twili, Weapon Spirits that inhabit an Extending weapon (such an ARMS), Zora. The following races would likely not have ARMS, on the basis of being magic or mineral: Demons, Fairies, Gorons, most other Weapon Spirits. The one race that may potentially fit in any of these categories are the Subrosians, due to the mystery of their true nature. A GM is well within their rights to declare them animals, minerals, or magic, and thus (dis)allow the technique as appropriate. ",

While the attributes and elements are not perfectly equivalent, the Elemental Weapon enchantment can serve as a good substitute. As such, the Elemental Blow technique – shown below – approximates the charging of a weapon attribute and attack, with the potential for a secondary effect appropriate to that Element. New Benefit: Elemental Weapon . If your Weapon has the Elemental Weapon enchantment, you gain access to the following technique in addition to Elemental Chaff: . Elemental Blow . Cost: 3 Stamina Use Requirement: A Weapon with the Elemental Weapon Enchantment Range: Weapon Damage: Weapon + (Enchantment Rank), of the weapon’s Element Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is inflicted with the element’s corresponding status effect (see the table for Elemental Weapon).

    "title": "Remember That One Time? Version Agnostic",
    "content": "Art by Jan Steen . Today, we’re highlighting an idea for a game session that isn’t terribly Zelda specific, but could be used in any tabletop system for a unique, irreverent, and enjoyable time: “Remember That One Time?” . “Remember That One Time” is a way to set up and play through some fun, light-hearted, comedic scenes, without worrying about exactly how the Heroes got themselves into that particular mess. It’s a great way to take a breather between epic quests, or to play a session while you’re missing important players. This idea originally comes from a Reddit post by boomerxl, which we found while researching “beach episode” RPG sessions. It was so cool, though, we wanted to highlight it in its own post! Check out below for more details about how to use this idea in your own game. To start, have your Heroes in a place where they can spend some quality time together, reminiscing and telling stories about their adventures so far. They could be doing this in a tavern, around a campfire, or just sitting around a dinner table (be it some host’s, or their own). The important thing is to be in a relaxed, safe place, where Heroes are free to tell hilarious or crazy stories to pass the time. Then, have one Hero start things off by saying “Hey, remember that one time…” and then follow it up with the set-up for some incredible story. This sets up the scenario that the Gm and the Heroes will then act out, as if it were happening right there, right then. While this sounds like the set-up for a clip show – and the idea is definitely similar! – there are two rules to this game that keep things interesting: . | First, the thing you’re remembering must be an event that hasn’t been seen in-game, but could have occurred ‘between sessions’ or ‘off-camera’. This is not an excuse to play some reruns! | Second, the player saying “Remember that one time…” can only state the set-up for the thing you’re all remembering. The actual conclusion will instead be played out by the Heroes ‘back then’. | . For instance, one Hero might begin with, “Remember when that Cucco took a nap on your Pack, Harald?” The Heroes would then flash back to when that Cucco took a nap on Harald’s pack, with the GM helping set the scene – perhaps with some input by the other Players, to determine when it would’ve been best for this to occur. With the scene set, the Heroes and GM would then play out the scenario, describing all of the increasingly-desperate ways that they tried to dislodge a stubborn, sleepy Cucco from their friend’s rucksack. (Don’t worry too much about what the Heroes’ Traits or Equipment “should have been” back then – first and foremost, this is meant to be a light and breezy activity!) . Playing a round of ‘Remember That One Time’ is a great way to round out a day at the beach, sitting around a campfire and laughing with your mates. If your players are having fun, you could even spend a whole session of play just doing this! . ",

    "content": "Hexagonal grids, like squares, are a way of breaking down a map into manageable increments. As such, both hexes and squares distort the map in ways that don’t make intuitive sense to humans. The following is partly taken from the Wikipedia page on hex maps, with simplified language! . Compared to squares, hexes have the following advantages: . | The distance between a hex’s center and its neighbor is always equal, when real-world measurements as used. This is in contrast to a square-grid, where a square’s cardinal neighbors’ centers are closer than the diagonal neighbors’. | For Reclaim the Wild, the difference in diagonal movement described above requires alternating the cost of moving squares. The first diagonal square costs 1 movement, while the second diagonal square costs 2 movement, then the third diagonal square costs 1 movement again… and so on. As such, hexes make diagonal movement simpler, because you just count each hex as a point of movement. | . Likewise, hexes have the following disadvantages: . | As seen in the previous section, movement along one axis cannot be straight. Flat-top hexagons do not allow simple east-west movement, and flat-side hexagons do not allow simple north-south movement. Zig-zagging movement must be used. | Movement happens in 6 directions compared to the 8 in a square-grid map. This may reduce your options to escape, and allows 6 enemies to fully surround a Medium creature rather than 8! | Partial hexes may come up when dealing with structures, which are often created as squares or rectangles. Movement within a partial hex may be restricted, despite not making much sense from a “real world” perspective. Just keep in mind that Reclaim the Wild uses video game logic more so than many other systems. | . ",

    "title": "What about attack ranges?",
    "content": "Most attack ranges work the same, just with hexes instead of squares. Just start counting from a hex next to your character, toward your intended target! The main difference with squares is the counting of diagonals. Diagonal movement doesn’t follow the 1-2-1 rule of squares, so diagonal movement is somewhat easier! . Below you will see a collection of various attack ranges, with the blue hex being the user of the ability, and red hexes being the range of the ability. Examples of various Attack Ranges on a hex map . Blast is the first range worth noting, given its explicitly square-like nature that ignores the 1-2-1 diagonal distance counting. At first I thought to make the ranges match up with the equivalent creature size, but ultimately that would make the ranges resemble a circle. Instead, I settled upon a square-like shape, where the length and width of the range are the same. Bursts, lines, and sweeps are mostly the same, though of course there are only six hexes around a medium creature, and diagonal movement is simple to count. Cones work quite fine when the cone begins with two hexes and spreads out from there (see the bottom three figures labeled cone), but work quite strangely when the cone begins with a single hex (see the top three cone figures). Ultimately, the easiest variant was following similar rules as the cones in the base system: X hexes forward, with the width increasing by 2 for every hex forward it moves. The shape looks strange in the abstraction of a hex map, but it mostly works the same. Just check if you’re using the Friendly Fire master mode before you shoot such a cone! . However, if drawing a cardinal-facing cone is too strange or covers too much ground, then just stick to the cones in the bottom half of the image. Below you will see an equivalent map for the “X targets/squares within Y squares” map shown for attack ranges. The brown hexes are enemies, and the purple hexes are cover. As you can see, the hex system has six enemies be within range of the “3 targets in 8 squares” attack, while the square system has five enemies be within range. Example of “3 Targets within 8 Hexes” Attack Range . This is all the information I currently have for using hexadecimals. Let me know if you have any questions!

Instead, it is only healed through consuming Dishes, Elixirs, and through rest. Binding Health . Health that is Bound is temporarily taken from the character’s pool of current health for the purposes of a benefit. When the character decides to Unbind the Health, then the Health will return to their current health. If a Hero is reduced to less than 1 HP while having Bound Health, then Unbind that Health (in whatever order the player chooses, if there are multiple pools of Bound Health) and apply damage as appropriate. However, if the Health cannot be voluntarily Unbound, then the character will fall Helpless. Spending Health . Health that is Spent is similar to taking damage, except that the Health returns after the end of a battle or scene. Do note that if you are attacked while Helpless, you will die, even if your Health has been Spent rather than Burned. A character should have at least 1 Health remaining after Binding, Spending, or Burning Health for any purpose. Otherwise, they’ll collapse and become Helpless! . Of course, all this information on how Health can be Spent, Bound, and Burned is useless without anything to Spend, Bind, and Burn the Health on.

    "title": "Duels and Other Arranged Battles",
    "content": "In Reclaim the Wild, non-serious battles may be costly in terms of resources, despite the lower stakes involved. Any Health that is lost due to damage usually won’t return without consuming a Dish or Elixir, taking a Long Rest, or Burning Magic using healing spells. However, there might come a time when two characters may come to blows, be it to resolve a disagreement, uphold honor, test the other’s strength, or just for fun. If the cost for such a small-stakes battle is high, such as needing to spend time, money, or dishes recovering health, then perhaps the battle may not happen, at the cost of a good story. The following rules can be used to reduce the cost of health recovery, by having characters Spend rather than Burn Health over the course of a battle. First, consent should be obtained from all the players (and the GM) at the table. Just because rules for Hero-on-Hero battles exist, does not mean they should be forced onto an unwilling group. Everyone’s play style should be taken into consideration, so that no one is uncomfortable, resentful or bored. Some players would prefer that a Hero-to-Hero disagreement be resolved with words. Others would rather not stand around watching two people beat each other up. And a few may even have had poor experience with dueling in their real life. If the participants of an arranged battle agree – either explicitly or implicitly – to not fight to death (or are ordered to, in the case of instinctive or limited intelligence combatants), then the Game Master may allow the participants to Spend Health whenever they take damage, rather than Burn. Generally, NPCs may only agree to an arranged battle if they of a semi-friendly disposition toward the Hero, such as if they are fellows in the same society, or are part of a sports or combat tournament where non-lethal combat is the norm. Very rarely will the servants of a great evil agree to a duel; typically, honorable people do not serve great evils. Instinctive and limited intelligence combatants do not understand arranged battles, and will not follow their rules unless instructed otherwise. The GM has the right to not use these rules, and NPCs cannot be compelled to use them. All damage is resolved the same way, applying Defense and Resistance as appropriate, and the amount is reduced from the character’s temporary and total health. Once reduced to 0 Health, the character cannot fight any longer, and is removed from the battle. When the battle concludes, all participants can stand up, restored to the Health they had before the arranged Battle began. The Heroes will be dirty and scuffed, but little worse for the wear. If Master Mode is used, do not apply Injuries. As an optional rule, the GM may decide that some combat wear remains. Perhaps all Health is restored, except for 1 Point. If Master Mode is used, then perhaps up to 1 Injury should be applied. This will prevent even the mightiest of heroes from dueling dozens of times without any rest. If durability is a concern, sparring weapons could be used. Perhaps the participants could agree to not use their best armor and weaponry, or they can be provided a standardized set of gear if the arranged battle is through an organization. Level 0 weapons and armor could be crafted or bought. Arranged Battle Usage Ideas . A Gerudo woman, having left home for the first time, is eager to prove herself to the people of Hyrule – perhaps not understanding the local culture. She stands up onto a bar’s table and issues an open challenge! Perhaps she’s just drunk, perhaps she offers a cash reward, or perhaps she is looking for someone stronger than her to help her with a problem! . A particularly famous singer in Inkopolis desires for her chosen side in this week’s Splatfest to be victorious. Though she has valuable information, she will refuse to part with it unless the group enters and wins a Splatfest battle. Victory in a Splatfest comes through territorial control, but interrupting the efforts of the enemy team is a very effective and common strategy! .

Player characters are no exception. The classical Hookshot uses Stamina and is a mechanical cylinder that has a grip on one end, and a grappling hook on the other. Curled inside its metal casing is a long metal chain. When the trigger is pulled, the hook fires straight ahead, grabbing onto whatever it hits, and attempts to retract. A Hookshot that uses Magic may instead be a hollow cylinder with runes inscribed on the outside. With the use of Magic, a hook made of energy forms and fires at the directed location. Other potential varieties include: . | A special bracer that is easily concealed under clothes; | A grappling gun with a line that attaches to a utility belt; | A small summoning circle; | A plant vine that can be directed with magic; | A snake-like Armos that can extend on command; | Gas-powered piston-shot grapple hooks attached to a full-body harness; | Canisters that shoot off fluids that harden into fibers. | . The appearance and mechanics of a Hookshot might depend on its creator, the world, and the themes and tone of your campaign. GMs and players should work together to stretch their creativity! . ",

    "content": "Crafting a Hookshot requires a Forge and consumes: . | 1 unit of Monster Parts | 3 units of Cloth | 5 units of Ancient material | 7 units of Metal | . … all of the same rank. This creates a Hookshot of that Rank. (You can, of course, use higher-Ranked Materials, but the Hookshot will be of the lowest-Ranked unit of Material used in its construction.) . The Rank of Materials you can use to craft a Hookshot is limited by your Mechanics Trait: you may only use Materials of a Rank equal to (Mechanics / 2, rounded down) or less. Deconstructing a Hookshot . Deconstructing a Hookshot typically returns 1 Cloth, 2 Ancient Materials, and 4 Metal, of the Hookshot’s Rank. If the Hookshot was made with a different combination of Cloth, Metal and Ancient material than is typical, then you might get back a different amount of those Materials, based on that ratio. Or, for simplicity, you could just get back 4 Metal and 1 Cloth, even if Metal and Cloth were not used in construction of the Hookshot. Upgrading a Hookshot . Hookshots can be upgraded, allowing you to improve their abilities and alter their Personal Touches (see below). Upgrading a Hookshot is mechanically the same as creating a new Hookshot, and deconstructing the old Hookshot at the same time: you consume Materials to create your new Hookshot at the new Rank, and you receive the Materials of the Hookshot’s old Rank from deconstructing it. Personal Touches . When you craft or upgrade a Hookshot, you also decide on its Personal Touches, much like when you build a Castle using the rules found in Rebuild the Wild. Hookshots may have up to (Rank) many Personal Touches. Each Personal Touch may only be taken once, unless otherwise stated. When you upgrade a Hookshot, you may change any existing Personal Touches it had, in addition to adding new Personal Touches based on its Rank. Below are just a handful of the Personal Touches your Hookshot might have – but don’t be afraid to discuss your own ideas for Personal Touches with your GM! . | Attuned: This Hookshot is specifically attuned to you. Treat this as if the Hookshot had the “Loyal” Enchantment on it, of a Rank equal to the Hookshot’s Rank. Further, anyone who does not have your explicit permission to use the Hookshot will treat the target of any of the Spells or Techniques granted by the Hookshot as being Hard to Hit. | Belt-Mounted: You may use your Hookshot if it is in one of your Belt slots, without needing a free hand. | Extension Lock: You can decide to keep the Hookshot’s chain extended once you’ve fired it, rather than immediately reeling it in. While locked, a taut chain extends in a straight line between you and the target, preventing either of you from moving any further from the other (though you may move closer, reeling in the chain as you approach). When someone attempts to move through the chain, you may attempt a special Combat Maneuver as a Reaction: Athletics and Perception vs. Concentration; on success, the target is immediately Knocked Prone. As long as the chain is taut, your allies can also walk along the chain like a tightrope; an Agility or Athletics trait check may be necessary to do so. | Failsafe: When you use the Hookshot Spell, you learn whether the target is lighter or heavier than yourself. You may then choose to have the Spell fail, preventing any movement. For instance, if you learn that a tree branch you used the Hookshot on is lighter than you, you can engage the failsafe and prevent the Hookshot from reeling the tree branch towards you. | Hookshot Expertise: When you target a willing ally with Ravio’s Hookshot, you can choose to pull yourself toward your ally, or your ally toward yourself, regardless of your relative weights. You can always target an ally with Wings of Freedom and be pulled toward them, regardless of your relative weights. | Hookshot Save: You gain the Hookshot Save Spell. You can cast it even if your Hookshot is in your Belt slot and you do not have the Belt-Mounted Personal Touch; you replace anything in one Hand with your Hookshot as part of casting that spell. | Jabu-Jabu’s Switchhook: You can use the Jabu-Jabu’s Switchhook Spell, using the same resource (Magic or Stamina) as with Ravio’s Hookshot, with the same benefits. | Pinpoint Shot: When rolling To-Hit using Spells and Techniques granted by the Hookshot, increase your roll by (1 + (Rank / 2)). | Practiced Efficiency: Reduce the cost of using all the Spells and Techniques granted by the Hookshot by 25%, as if you have taken the Practiced Efficiency feat for all of them. | Reinforced: The Hookshot gains (Rank + 1) extra Durability. | Shrinkable: This Hookshot can shrink and grow back to size on command. It can be safely placed within a Pack’s Key Items pouch, rather than in the Tools pouch. It can also easily be used when the Hero is under the effects of any shrinking effects that the Hookshot was not also affected by. | Wings of Freedom: You can use the Wings of Freedom Spell, using the same resource (Magic or Stamina) as with Ravio’s Hookshot, with the same benefits. | Reel In: You can use the Reel In Spell, using the same resource (Magic or Stamina) as with Ravio’s Hookshot, with the same benefits. | .

He pulls himself past a pit to land next to the Moblin, then attacks the Moblin with his standard action. Finally, he uses Wings of Freedom to pull himself northward to be on the other side of the pit. The Hylian can also use Wings of Freedom to aim the Hookshot at the purple block above the southern set of pits. He can swing over eastward toward the Moblin, then northward. However, he would not be able to swing past the northern pit; as such, he’d have to use the hookshot on the block directly north of him.

We’ve long had stories of people from our mundane, humdrum world being sucked into fantastical realms of fiction. Even within the space of games, 80’s cartoons like Captain N: The Game Master and Dungeons &amp; Dragons have featured people being ‘sucked into the game’, and using their knowledge and skills to save a world they once believed was simple fantasy. These works are sometimes known as “Portal Fantasy”, a term which also includes classic works like The Wizard of Oz. These days, though, you might know them by a specific Japanese term: “Isekai”. Isekai has become a whole genre of anime and manga unto itself, inundating bookstores and magazines to the point where it seems ubiquitous. Reclaim the Wild, by virtue of being based directly on a popular video game, is well-suited to running a tabletop Isekai campaign. After all, part of the appeal of an Isekai work is applying the heroes’ knowledge of ‘how the game works’ to solving problems great and small in their new home! But how should you go about running a proper Isekai campaign? . Below, we discuss some ideas for doing just that. Check it out below! . ",

    "content": "Most Isekai stories approach their subject matter in one of two ways. As a GM who wants to run an Isekai campaign, you should decide which of these better describes the game you want to run. | A power fantasy. The Heroes of the story will be powerful, fated, or otherwise blessed. Any items or knowledge they bring with them from their old world serve to further elevate them above other people, or to make them powerful enough to handle whatever that world’s Heroes could not. | A struggle to adapt to a dangerous, unknown world, where all the rules they knew are thrown out the window. In these stories, the Heroes are usually no more special than anyone else; any additional blessings or knowledge they bring with might be all that’s keeping them from dying to the things they don’t know about. | . If you intend to take the “Power Fantasy” tact, we recommend focusing on game knowledge as the main ‘extra blessing’, plus or minus your Heroes being fated to save the world (or whatever task you place before them). Don’t give them super-powerful stats or equipment, as Reclaim the Wild functions best when Heroes earn that kind of power over the course of their adventures. However, granting them some special Magical Tool to help them solve puzzles, and to serve as a ‘reminder’ of their Isekai origins, is not out of the question. In a Power Fantasy, some important figures may know about the Heroes, their origins, and their purpose in Hyrule – in short, your players may already have allies that they just haven’t met yet. If you go the “Struggle in an Unknown Land” route, we recommend popping your Heroes in a dangerous place right from the start: an abandoned temple in the middle of the woods, for instance, or even deep within a villain’s dungeon. Any ‘starting’ equipment might instead be found shortly after the adventure’s beginning. The Heroes begin with little to no knowledge of how to get home, or even why they’ve been brought to Hyrule; instead, that knowledge will be a reward that they have to seek out. This would be well-suited to a hexcrawl adventure, where the Heroes have to uncover the secrets of their new world while they also search for a way home – they have no guides beyond their own knowledge, what they see, and whomever they can convince.

    "content": "Often, Isekai works will quickly wave off any concerns about their protagonists going home. After all, they want to explore their fantastical realm, and having a Hero go home simply puts an end to that. However, there’s plenty of room to explore the tensions between the call of adventure, and the desire to return to one’s comfortable origins. To that end, we can look at some other Isekai works to highlight some ways to do that! . The old 80’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon features Heroes who want to return home, and this highlights an easy way to get your Heroes to bite on any adventure lead: simply mention that it might offer a way home, and they will jump at the chance. Obviously, this requires your players to agree to want to go home – or at least, to agree to have reasonable, roleplay-able discussions about it in-character. The original Digimon anime is a great example of an Isekai game where the Heroes’ return home results in new stories to tell, rather than simply being the end of the story. There, allies and enemies from the Digital World follow the protagonists back to their (and our) reality. This give them an opportunity to ratchet up the tension (by putting the Heroes’ families and homes at risk). It also lets them reverse the Isekai structure, by letting their fantastical elements (Digimon) be the fishes out of water, exploring and learning about our world. Regardless of if and when your Heroes return home, they should need to explore your campaign world and undertake plenty of adventure before they can punch their return ticket. Be wary of letting your Heroes pop back and forth between the Isekai world and their home world too easily! If they can just nip home to see their family and pick up modern equipment, it can remove your game’s tension and seriously derail the plot. ",

    "content": "With all that said, there’s one thing left to address: not about running any ol’ Isekai game, but about running a Zelda Isekai game, specifically. Races. A Hero’s Race is an important part of who they are and what they can do in Reclaim the Wild – and preventing players from selecting a Race may hamper their ability to play the way they want to. Consider allowing your Heroes to begin with one of the Races presented in the rulebook, even though they’re coming from a humdrum, human-inhabited world. Perhaps they’re transformed into their new Race as part of their summoning, or their new body is somehow based on a person in the Zelda universe (somewhat like the heroic masks in Majora’s Mask). Traits and Magic. Similarly, just because we don’t have magic in our world, and don’t often find cause to unsheathe a sword and fight to the death, doesn’t mean your Heroes should be limited by those same concerns once they arrive in the land of Hyrule. Much like the Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon, they might be gifted their starting Traits, Spells, and Techniques to better suit their new heroic destinies upon arriving, or be empowered by the Goddesses as they are flung from one mortal coil to another by the likes of Truck-kun. Which Zelda game? You may want to decide if your Heroes are being brought into a specific Hyrule (that is, a single instance of Hyrule as presented in just one of the many Zelda games) or whether they’re being brought into a Hyrule that represents an amalgamation of them all. You don’t even have to limit yourself to an existing game’s design, if you choose the first option; you may wave your hands and say “this is the exact same game world as this wholly fictional Zelda video game” – rather like how the matter is handled in the beginning of Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced. NPCs. There are a fair few fan-favorite NPCs who have recurring roles in multiple Zelda games; moreso than in other Reclaim the Wild campaigns, you should try to include these NPCs as people in your game world. You may want to ask your players who they’d like to run into on their Isekai adventure, and what they’d like to do with them, especially if you’re going the Power Fantasy route.

Art by Nintendo . The Sheikah Slate is a versatile tool in Breath of the Wild, providing all sorts of benefits: from taking photos to providing a map, casting spells to teleporting across Hyrule, it’s almost too good to be true! And in many ways, it was. But now, so long after the debut of Reclaim the Wild, we can provide a (somewhat) balanced way of having Sheikah Slates in tabletop! . ",

    "content": "The Sheikah Slate is a rather complicated tool that not just any Magitechnologist can craft. As such, the feat below represents the specialized training required to craft a Sheikah Slate. New Feat: Sheikah Slate Craft . 3 tokens Requirement: Quest Reward or GM Approval Only Effect: You can now craft the Sheikah Slate. When you learn this feat, choose between Magic or Stamina. Any Sheikah Slate you craft will use the resource you specify. Special: You can take this feat more than once. This will allow you to choose whether the Sheikah Slate you craft will use Magic or Stamina. This may require completing a different quest. Starting with a Sheikah Slate . The Sheikah Slate is relatively expensive to craft (see below), so a player cannot start the game with one without a GM’s permission. If the GM does decide to allow a player to begin with a Sheikah Slate, we recommend keeping the Sheikah Slate to either Rank 1 or Rank 0, depending on the character and their circumstances. We also recommend replacing one of the character’s starting Tools with their starting Sheikah Slate. If the GM wishes, Sheikah Slates for starting players can lack some or all of the base functionality, and the players can unlock that base functionality as they play the game. ",

    "content": "The Sheikah Slate is a one-handed Personalised Tool that grants the user multiple benefits. Some of these benefits use either Magic or Stamina, as determined by the Sheikah Slate Craft feat options the creator has. The Sheikah Slate comes with the following Runes preinstalled: . | Camera Rune: Allows the use of the Camera spell, using either Magic or Stamina, as determined by the Sheikah Slate feat options the creator has. | Album Rune: Can hold (Rank + 1) * 5 free photographs with the Camera spell before needing to use your own Magic or Stamina. | Magical Song Rune: Allows the use of any number of Magical Songs. The Slate can learn or teach Magical Songs in the same manner as anyone else. When playing a Magical Song using this Rune, use [(Mechanics + the Slate’s Rank)/3] to determine Musical Power. | Misc Runes: Your Slate can keep track of dates, time, provide current weather information (including temperature), and you can write in your Slate. | Scope Rune: Can be used as Telescope of the same Rank. | Spell and Technique Runes: Allows you to temporarily use Spells or Techniques by channeling them through the Slate; typically these will not directly deal damage. Spells and Techniques will use the same resource as the Camera Rune. You can unlock or gain individual Runes through quest rewards, as determined by the GM. In addition, you can gain improvements to the Spells and Techniques, such as applying the Wizardly bonus, or Practiced Efficiency (and similar feats), as rewards. | . If To-Hit Rolls are called for when using the Sheikah Slate, the Slate’s Accuracy is 5. Any bonuses gained from the base Slate functionality or the Personal Touches do not stack with those provided by other Tools (typically Written Books or Toolkits). The Sheikah Slate uses Durability much like a weapon would; see the rules for the Everything Breaks Master Mode. Only subtract Durability once for each scene in which the Sheikah Slate is used, similar to usage of a Weapon in battle; certain uses of the Slate (such as viewing photographs or using Misc Runes) do not take Durability. Unlike weapons, the Sheikah Slate can be repaired; see the rules for Repairing &amp; Upgrading Weapon Spirits. Heroes may place Sheikah Slates in their Pack, in the Tools pouch. Sheikah Slate Appearance . Sheikah Slates have a varied appearance both within and outside the land of Hyrule. Skilled Sheikah Slate craftsmen, rare as they are, often put their own personal spin on the Tool. Player characters are no exception. The classical Sheikah Slate is a palm-sized device with a screen on one side, the Crest of the Sheikah on the other, a handle, and a ring. Other potential varieties include: . | A clamshell design that protects the screen; | A small device strapped to the wrist; | A projector that creates interactive holograms; | A device attached to your ear with a visor going over one eye; | A table-sized slate designed to be stationary within a building. | . Cultures outside (or even inside) of Hyrule may refer to these devices by different names: . | Uncle Rupee and his employees call his version Tingle Tuners; | Inkling scholars refer to them as Abstracti (singular abstractus); | More common inkling soldiers call them abbeys (from ABstractus), or inkpads. | Cultures in contact with the Galactic Federation may refer to them as Datapads or Dataslates; | Silph Pads in the Pokemon World; | Super Tablets in the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding kingdoms; | Agarthans would call them pedestrian; | The inhabitants of Popstar call them Star Mirrors; | Angel Land inhabitants can call them Divine Tablets. | . The appearance and mechanics of a Sheikah Slate might depend on its creator, the world, and the themes and tone of your campaign. GMs and players should work together to stretch their creativity! .

    "content": "Crafting a Sheikah Slate requires a Forge and consumes: . | 1 unit of Luminous Stone | 3 units of Topaz | 5 units of Wood | 7 units of Ancient material | . … all of the same rank. This creates a Sheikah Slate of that Rank. (You can, of course, use higher-Ranked Materials, but the Sheikah Slate will be of the lowest-Ranked unit of Material used in its construction.) . The Rank of Materials you can use to craft a Sheikah Slate is limited by your Enchanting and Mechanics Traits: you may only use Materials of a Rank equal to [the lower of (Enchanting / 2, rounded down) or (Mechanics / 2, rounded down)], or less. However, you can cooperate with another crafter that has the same version of the feat you chose (both Magic, or both Stamina). In that case, you and your partner will use the higher value for both the Enchanting and Mechanics requirements. Deconstructing a Sheikah Slate . Deconstructing a Sheikah Slate typically returns 1 Topaz and 2 Wood, and 4 Ancient Materials of the Sheikah Slate’s Rank. If the Sheikah Slate was made with a different combination of Wood and Ancient material than is typical, then you might get back a different amount of those Materials, based on that ratio. Or, for simplicity, you could just get back 4 Ancient and 1 Wood, even if Wood was not used in construction of the Sheikah Slate. Upgrading a Sheikah Slate . Sheikah Slates can be upgraded, allowing you to improve their abilities and alter their Personal Touches (below). Upgrading a Sheikah Slate is mechanically the same as creating a new Sheikah Slate, and deconstructing the old Sheikah Slate at the same time: you consume Materials to create your new Sheikah Slate at the new Rank, and you receive the Materials of the Sheikah Slate’s old Rank from deconstructing it. Screenshot from Breath of the Wild . Personal Touches . When you craft or upgrade a Sheikah Slate, you also decide on its Personal Touches, much like when you build a Castle using the rules found in Rebuild the Wild. Sheikah Slates may have up to (Rank) many Personal Touches. Each Personal Touch may only be taken once, unless otherwise stated. When you upgrade a Sheikah Slate, you may change any existing Personal Touches it had, in addition to adding new Personal Touches based on its Rank. Below are just a handful of the Personal Touches your Sheikah Slate might have – but don’t be afraid to discuss your own ideas for Personal Touches with your GM! . | Aim Assist Rune: When rolling To-Hit Evasion using Spells and Techniques granted by the Slate, increase your roll by (1 + (Rank / 2)). | Attunement Rune: This Sheikah Slate is specifically attuned to you. Treat this as if the Sheikah Slate had the “Loyal” Enchantment on it, of a Rank equal to the Sheikah Slate’s Rank. Further, anyone who does not have your explicit permission to use the Sheikah Slate will treat the target of any of the Spells or Techniques granted by the Sheikah Slate as being Hard to Hit, impose a -2 penalty to all bonuses granted by the Slate (this can be negative), and will have their Musical Power be reduced by 2. | Azuretooth Accessory: You may use your Sheikah Slate if it is in one of your Belt slots, without needing a free hand. Cloying Rune: When rolling To-Hit Concentration using Spells and Techniques granted by the Slate, increase your roll by (1 + (Rank / 2)). | Forceful Rune: When rolling To-Hit Vitality using Spells and Techniques granted by the Slate, increase your roll by (1 + (Rank / 2)). | Improved Album and Camera Runes: Your number of free photograph slots is doubled. In addition, you can manipulate the images with filters, by marking certain parts of the image, and the like. | Knowledge Rune: Choose a benefit of a Written Book or Toolkit that your GM allows. This Slate acts as the chosen Tool of the same Rank. This can be taken multiple times; each time you take it, choose a different benefit. | Light Rune: The Slate can be used as a Lantern of the same rank. | Lore Codex Rune: When you take this option, choose one of the following traits: Arcana, Civilization, Mechanics, or Nature. When you use Learn Lore with that trait, you gain a (Rank / 2) bonus. This does not stack with bonuses from any other Tools. This can be taken multiple times; each time you take it, select a different trait. | Musical Rune: The Slate can be used as a Phonograph of the same rank. It can record and save sounds for up to [(Rank + 1) * 5] minutes, and can both read and write Discs. In addition, it can be used as a regular Instrument of the same rank. You can use the regular Musical Power formula instead of the one provided by the Magical Song Rune. | Navigation Rune: The Slate provides a Map of the surrounding area. This map’s details are based on either what is programmed into the Slate, and is otherwise based upon what the user can see. Add (Rank / 2) to any trait checks related to navigation, as long as you have a map of the area you are trying to navigate. | Screen Protection Rune: The Sheikah Slate gains (Rank + 1) extra Durability. | Sending Rune: Your Sheikah Slate gains a unique communication rune. Other Slates that have that rune recorded can send messages to you. If your slate has another’s sending rune, you can use this Sheikah Slate to communicate with other Slates, within a certain distance based upon Rank; see below. You may also send (or receive) your messages without the communication rune, but the results may vary. Certain buildings may be able to increase the effective range. Communication may be with spoken words, typed words, or images. | . | RANK | RANGE | . | 0 | Within and around a building | . | 1 | About the size of a small village | . | 2 | Large city, or a village and much of the countryside | . | 3 | Most anywhere within a country | . | 4 | Anywhere in the world | . | 5 | Anywhere in the world and any other | . | Shrinking Rune: This Sheikah Slate can shrink and grow back to size on command. It can be safely placed within a Pack’s Key Items pouch, rather than in the Tools pouch. It can also easily be used when the Hero is under the effects of any shrinking effects that the Sheikah Slate was not also affected by. | Surveying Rune: The Slates grants a +(Rank / 2) bonus to finding a specific type of Material (Ancient, Gems, Metal, etc). This does not stack with similar bonuses from Written Books, Toolkits, and other Tools. This can be taken multiple times; each time you take this Personal Touch, choose a different Material. | . ",

    "title": "Sheikah Slate Modes",
    "content": "As befitting an important item like the Sheikah Slate, here are some optional rules that can be used to change how the Sheikah Slate works. Master Mode: Irreparable Sheikah Slates . As a Master Mode rule, your GM may disallow Sheikah Slate repair and upgrades. This brings Sheikah Slates into line with Weapons and most other equipment, which cannot be safely repaired or upgraded unless inhabited by a Weapon Spirit. Master Mode: Sheikah Slate Spellbook . To better create a setting similar to Breath of the Wild in which magic can’t be personally learned, you can have all Spell knowledge and Magic be stored in the personal Sheikah Slates given to all Heroes. When using this mode, the Spell and Technique Runes and Improved Spell and Technique Runes benefits are removed, and instead the player can invest any amount of tokens they want into Spells that are stored on the Slate. In addition, investment in Magic will provide more Magic Points for the Slate to use, and the Spells will be channeled through to the Heroes’ Weapon(s). The players and GMs should discuss with each other if the Slates can be stolen or otherwise lost to deprive the Heroes of their spells. Assist Mode: Sheikah Slate Pack . If the tone of your campaign is more futuristic or video game-like, you can have Sheikah Slates act as a Pack. As such, the Slate will be placed in the Pack slot, and will follow the same rules as a regular Pack. A new Sheikah Slate made from scratch will have no pockets. With this assist mode, the Shrinking Rune will not allow the placement of a Sheikah Slate into the Key Item slot; however, if the Slate shrinks, then so will the contents. Newly created (or found) Slates won’t have Packs automatically; the Materials for a new Pack must be added to the Slate. Assist Mode: Different Default Personal Touches . Depending on the setting and thematics of the campaign, you can change the type of personal touches that are available by default. For instance, in a Hyrule where Sheikah tech was allowed to flourish and society somewhat resembles the modern world, all Sheikah Slates could have the Navigation and Sending Runes available as the default. Alternatively, damaged Slates could have many of the baseline benefits locked away until fixed or otherwise unlocked. Assist Mode: Selectable Spell and Technique Runes . By default, the Sheikah Slate’s selection of Techniques and Spells are fully in control of the GM (with input from players). This is because unlike other Personalized Items like the Hookshot, the Sheikah Slate is relatively open-ended in what sorts of Spells and Techniques would be appropriate. With this Assist Mode, players gain the opportunity to choose for themselves what options they’d like to take, up to a point. This will also help to differentiate the options available to all players, as unless scarcity is added, each hero’s Slate will likely share all runes gained during group quests. The use of this Mode is meant to compliment quest rewards, not replace them. Change the Spells &amp; Techniques Rune baseline option to the following: . | Spell and Technique Runes: Allows you to temporarily use Spells or Techniques by channeling them through the Slate. Choose which combinations of valid non-damaging Spells and Techniques can be granted by the Slate, as long as the total token cost does not exceed [(Rank + 1) * 3] tokens. The Spells and Techniques you can choose are determined by your GM; see the section “Determining Valid Spells and Techniques for Tutoring” in the Tutoring enchantment article for guidelines. You may swap out your chosen Spells and Techniques when you upgrade the Slate. Spells and Techniques will use the same resource as the Camera Rune. | . Add the following Personal Touches to the list of options: . | Rune Optimization: Reduce the cost of using all the Spells and Techniques granted by the Sheikah Slate by 25%, as if you have taken the Practiced Efficiency feat for all of them. | Wizardly Rune: Spells cast through the Slate gain the benefit of the Wizardly keyword. | Improved Spell and Technique Runes: The Sheikah Slate allows you to temporarily use Feats that improve or require Techniques or Spells granted by the Spell and Technique Runes personal touch. The Crafter chooses which combinations of feats can be granted by the Tutoring personal touch, as long as the total token cost does not exceed (3 * (Rank / 2), rounded up) tokens. See the table below. | . | SLATE RANK | TOKENS GRANTED | . | 0 | 0 | . | 1 | 3 | . | 2 | 3 | . | 3 | 6 | . | 4 | 6 | . | 5 | 9 | . Master Mode: Modular Sheikah Slate . With this Master Mode, the Sheikah Slate has (Rank) Tool slots. You can insert Tools into the slot to allow you to use the Sheikah Slate and the Tools without taking up more of your Hand (or Belt) slots. However, the Tools need to be separately upgraded (and maintained, if using the Everything Breaks master mode). Tools can be pulled out. Players and GMs should speak with each other to determine what Tools make sense and what don’t when it comes to inserting them into the Sheikah Slate. With this Master Mode, certain Rune options – like the Knowledge and Light Runes – may become unavailable at the GM’s discretion. ",

Screenshot from Breath of the Wild . Guidance Stones are the typical means that are used to add information to Sheikah Slates, though other forms certainly as possible! Feel free to include them as part of Sheikah Towers, Shrines, and other dungeons as means to grant quest rewards – in the form of greater functionality for Sheikah Slates. Using the Guidance Stones’ drop of knowledge on non-Sheikah Slate objects or creatures (such your PC’s own body) has no canon precedent, so feel free to try one of these outcomes… Or even mix and match! . | Nothing happens, as only Sheikah Slates can interpret the data. | You learn the information provided, be it a Spell or other information. | You get a headache (or stomach ache). | You gain a Wisdom injury. | You take 1 damage as the liquid burns the body. | You gain partial or scrambled knowledge of the Ancients. This knowledge might be related to the Guidance Stone’s spell, origins, history, or some broader goal the Ancients had.

For those who don’t want to spend a fortune buying or crafting shields for competitions or just daily travel, these Surfing Tools are a goddess-send! . By default, Surfing Tools do not take Durability damage when used for Shield Surfing in the terrain they were designed for. If a Surfing Tool is used for a surface it isn’t designed for, the Tool may either take durability damage, or may simply not work… A skateboard would simply sink into the snow, or into water, rather than provide even a modicum of movement. Surfing Tools are a subset of Mundane Tools and can be made from Ancient, Metal, or Wood Materials. Like other Mundane Tools, Surfing Tools come in ranks. When in their designated terrain, the tools gain (Rank) to Movement when Shield Surfing, before taking into account the surfing boost, and they add their (Rank) to any trait rolls made for moving through or stopping. For instance, when using ice skates on a frozen lake (a severely slick surface, in this case), you can add the ice skates’ rank to your Agility roll to safely stop! . Finally, every type of Surfing Tool provides a miscellaneous benefit as listed in the table below. This benefit applies while Shield Surfing, and also while using the Surfing Tool when not Shield Surfing. Surfing Tools can also be used on relatively flat surfaces, using the same actions as Shield Surfing.

Of these, the Song of Storms might be the most well-remembered, inspiring people to create remixes, covers, and even their own lyrics for the Magical Song. While the Song of Storms is rolled into the Wind’s Requiem in Reclaim the Wild, that doesn’t mean you can’t base a few adventures around it. Players will be sure to follow up any quest hook that’s flavored with this favorite song, in the hopes of learning it for themselves. | The desert town of Sunken Dune relies on the skilled dancer Palanhi, playing the Song of Storms, for their survival. The town receives no natural rainfall, and the nearest oasis is three days’ travel away. When desert thieves kidnap Palanhi away, the town is beside itself with panic. When the Heroes valiantly rush in to try and rescue her, however, they learn a startling truth – Palanhi asked to be kidnapped. The Heroes can either return her to her gilded cage, learn the song (and perhaps teach it to someone else in town), or, perhaps, find some more permanent solution to the town’s water problem. | A strange clock-maker is visiting Zora’s Domain, and selling music boxes for cheap. Everyone loves their tinkling tunes, and they echo off of the grotto walls beautifully. However, the music boxes hide a secret: they’re actually a clever kind of time bomb. In less than a day, the music boxes will all change their tune to the Song of Storms, and begin playing simultaneously. This will surely flood the Zora’s homeland, and cause a cascading torrent to wash away everything downstream, the question remains – why? | The town of Ilghaz has an annual festival for the Song of Storms. At the opening ceremony, the town’s choir gathers at an ancient monument, and sings the Song of Storms together, symbolically washing away the town’s sins. This year, however, the rains are red, and full of toads – an ill omen, to be sure. Is it truly a potent of bad things to come? A sign of some strange effect in the local lake?

    "content": "Those familiar with Ganon’s occasional attacks on the land of Hyrule are aware of the prevalence of undead within the ranks of his army of evil. From the sneaky poes, to the dreaded redead, to the fearsome stalfos, the appearance of undead is a sure sign that Ganon or another great evil is gaining power. The presence of dark magic drags those long since deceased back to rotten corpses, and twists tortured souls into willing servants of evil. Few, however, are aware that not all undead are under evil’s thrall. Due to uncommonly strong ties to the mortal world, whether a vital mission incomplete or a powerful force of love unfulfilled, some lost souls awaken and retain their minds despite the advanced decay of their physical bodies. Known as Stal-folk, these ambulatory skeletons often band together for mutual support. When possible, Stal-folk tribes form friendly ties with nearby communities of the “live ones”, though it must be said that fear of undead runs so deep among most villages that Stal-folk delegations are more often met by screams and drawn bows. Still, Stal-folk are not evil by nature and are capable of recognizing the inherent difficulties that come with such tasks. At first glance, Stal-folk appear little different from their fiercer Stalfos cousins. Both are the skeletons of former Hylians, Gerudo, or Sheikah, and they have the same variety in heights and builds. Those familiar with both varieties of undead can point out that Stal-folk tend to have a more relaxed posture; and their faces, despite being made of the same bone, have an oddly friendly softness to them in contrast to the harsh lines of Stalfos. Stal-folk wear clothing not too dissimilar to what they wore in life, whether that be peasant garb or a prince’s gilded armor, though social stratification is a virtually unknown concept in Stal-folk tribes. Death, after all, has made equals of them all. As they are not technically alive, Stal-folk can exist for a very long time indeed. If they do not meet a violent end, an individual Stalperson can go on for centuries; wandering the land, honing their skills, and experiencing things few mortal creatures ever can. The secret goal in every Stalperson’s heart is to finally achieve the goal that brought them back from the grave, so that they may finally rest in peace. ",

Below are some examples, just to get your inspiration flowing. | Gerudo warriors may be unused to the sea, let alone swimming in the ocean. But they are well acquainted with sand. For them, building sandcastles is a field of artistic competition and pride. Don’t be surprised if two Gerudo get into a kind of artistic grudge-match, attempting to build ever-grander sand-sculptures or nigh-unassailable sand-forts. (Pint-sized Fairies, or those with access to the Minish Minuet Song, may match the scale of these epic sandcastles, and exploring them like a funhouse or a realtor – if they aren’t soaking in a cool, fruity drink like it’s their personal pool.) | Gorons may be just as unfamiliar with the sea as the Gerudo, but for them, sand is just as enjoyable. Gorons might treat loose sand like others treat the water, rolling and lounging in it to cool off. Don’t be surprised if they set off a few Bombs beneath the sands, too, just to enjoy the cool sand-spray. | Rito enjoy the warm air of the beach and the cool air of the ocean, rising and falling with the winds. They (and any friendly Deku Scrubs) might enjoy parasailing, tying themselves to a boat and letting the wind pick them up and effortlessly carry them for miles. | Sheikah, Twili, and Demons are more likely to stay to the shade, and watch others as they pass by. They can spend a whole afternoon just commenting on the dress, drinks, and foibles of pedestrians. If they must step out into the sun, expect darkened glasses, hats, and copious lotion. | Zora are at home on the beach, though they may be more used to the water than the sand – for them, lounging on land with friends might be a unique treat. Zora youths often play ball-games in the water: They may try to keep the ball from touching the water for as long as possible (not unlike volleyball or hackeysack), or they may use it in a game of ‘Fireball’, where they must jump from the water and kick or throw the ball at other Zora, swimming on the surface of the water. | .

Here are some resources that you can use to look at Markdown’s Syntax : . | The official GitHub Markdown Cheat Sheet | The kramdown quick reference and full syntax | . To do a quick run of what “simple” Markdown looks like, think about how you would style your text on Discord : It uses the same syntax. Discord uses a simplified version of the Markdown specification. Everything you do there can be done here. One of the things that can be a bit weird first time are the newlines. In original Markdown, doing a newline won’t do what you wish for it to do. You’d need to do 2 new lines (With an empty line between your two paragraphs) to effectively create a new paragraph. However, ou parser, kramdown, does integrate a way to create line breaks in a single block, by adding 2 empty spaces at the end of your line! . In any case, if you’re in doubt and/or need anything, feel free to contact Meï, who’ll try to answer your questions as quickly as possible.

The same applies to this spacing section. This usually won’t be useful to the normal user. UNWRAP ME ! These spacers are available to use for margins and padding with responsive utility classes. Combine these prefixes with a screen size and spacing scale to use them responsively. | Classname prefix | What it does | . | .m- | margin | . | .mx- | margin-left, margin-right | . | .my- | margin top, margin bottom | . | .mt- | margin-top | . | .mr- | margin-right | . | .mb- | margin-bottom | . | .ml- | margin-left | . | Classname prefix | What it does | . | .p- | padding | . | .px- | padding-left, padding-right | . | .py- | padding top, padding bottom | . | .pt- | padding-top | . | .pr- | padding-right | . | .pb- | padding-bottom | . | .pl- | padding-left | . Spacing values are based on a 1rem = 16px spacing scale, broken down into these units: . | Spacer/suffix | Size in rems | Rem converted to px | . | 1 | 0.25rem | 4px | . | 2 | 0.5rem | 8px | . | 3 | 0.75rem | 12px | . | 4 | 1rem | 16px | . | 5 | 1.5rem | 24px | . | 6 | 2rem | 32px | . | 7 | 2.5rem | 40px | . | 8 | 3rem | 48px | . | auto | auto | auto | . Use mx-auto to horizontally center elements. Responsive modifiers . If you want to have different display between different screen sizes, you can put this size modifiers inbetween prefix &amp; suffix/spacer classes. | Modifier | Screen size | . | (none) | All screens until the next modifier | . | xs | 320px (20rem) and up | . | sm | 500px (31.25rem) and up | . | md | 740px (46.25rem) and up | . | lg | 1120px (70rem) and up | . | xl | 1400px (87.5rem) and up | . Examples . In Markdown, use the {: } wrapper to apply custom classes: . This paragraph will have a margin bottom of 1rem/16px at large screens. {: .mb-lg-4 } This paragraph will have 2rem/32px of padding on the right and left at all screen sizes. {: .px-6 } . Horizontal Alignment . | Classname | What it does | . | .float-left | float: left | . | .float-right | float: right | . | .flex-justify-start | justify-content: flex-start | . | .flex-justify-end | justify-content: flex-end | . | .flex-justify-between | justify-content: space-between | . | .flex-justify-around | justify-content: space-around | . Note: any of the flex- classes must be used on a parent element that has d-flex applied to it. Vertical Alignment . | Classname | What it does | . | .v-align-baseline | vertical-align: baseline | . | .v-align-bottom | vertical-align: bottom | . | .v-align-middle | vertical-align: middle | . | .v-align-text-bottom | vertical-align: text-bottom | . | .v-align-text-top | vertical-align: text-top | . | .v-align-top | vertical-align: top | . Display . Display classes aid in adapting the layout of the elements on a page: . | Class |   | . | .d-block | display: block | . | .d-flex | display: flex | . | .d-inline | display: inline | . | .d-inline-block | display: inline-block | . | .d-none | display: none | . Use these classes in conjunction with the responsive modifiers. Examples . In Markdown, use the {: } wrapper to apply custom classes: . These headings will be `inline-block`: ### heading 3 {: .d-inline-block } ### heading 3 {: .d-inline-block } . Typography Utilities . You’re used to it by now… . UNWRAP ME ! Font size . Use the .fs-1 - .fs-10 to set an explicit font-size. | Class | Small screen size font-size | Large screen size font-size | . | .fs-1 | 9px | 10px | . | .fs-2 | 11px | 12px | . | .fs-3 | 12px | 14px | . | .fs-4 | 14px | 16px | . | .fs-5 | 16px | 18px | . | .fs-6 | 18px | 24px | . | .fs-7 | 24px | 32px | . | .fs-8 | 32px | 38px | . | .fs-9 | 38px | 42px | . | .fs-10 | 42px | 48px | . Font size 1 . Font size 2 . Font size 3 . Font size 4 . Font size 5 . Font size 6 . Font size 7 . Font size 8 . Font size 9 . Font size 10 .

Font weight . Use the .fw-300 - .fw-700 to set an explicit font-size. Font weight 300 . Font weight 400 . Font weight 500 . Font weight 700 . In Markdown, use the `{: }` wrapper to apply custom classes: Font weight 300 {: .fw-300 } Font weight 400 {: .fw-400 } Font weight 500 {: .fw-500 } Font weight 700 {: .fw-700 } . Line height . Use the lh- classes to explicitly apply line height to text. | Class | line-height value | Notes | . | .lh-0 | 0 |   | . | .lh-tight | 1.1 | Default for headings | . | .lh-default | 1.4 | Default for body (paragraphs) | .

If it’s not, it will only be written as title. | . | The “permalink” property allows you to customize the URL of your page. It is, in fact, automatically generated, but you can tinker it further through this property. This can be useful to remove the “.html” at the end of the url, for example. If it is not mentionned, the permalink will be the path of the file, with the same name as your file at the end, but ended by .html instead of .md. You should try, whenever possible, to include this property. | . | The “parent” property is used to indicate the title of the parent of the page. It can be omitted for orphan pages, but most of your content should be the children of one of the category pages. The current parents available are : . | Enchantments | Creatures | Feats | Items | Misc. | Races | Rules | Songs | Spells | . | . | You can add a cool “last_modified_date” property if you want to display the last date this file was modified (Which you should !). The format is the following: last_modified_date: 2020-04-27T17:54:08+0000 where the second half is a ISO 8601 formatted UNIX Timestamp.

Contributors can be seen on the contributors page, but they’re not set exactly the same : Contributors are set through an id, also called a slug. On a general basis, the id is a lowercase-version of the user’s name, without whitespaces and special characters. For example, “Meï” becomes mei and “Elemental Knight” becomes elementalknight.

While physical prowess and resources may solve many problems in the world, there are some which require a more metaphysical touch. Magic is a very powerful tool and those scholars who have mastered it are revered – and rightfully so – but what are the more mundane or less mystically talented to do when faced with the need for a magical solution? From traveling priests offering a solution to the common folk even in their absence to the peddlers in street markets hawking protective charms, the Talisman is a respected source of pre-packaged magical potency. A small strip of cloth decorated with a magical phrase, mantra, or mystical pattern which befuddles many save for those versed in the enchanting arts, a Talisman is a sure sign that mystical forces are at play. Talismans are often employed at sacred sites or in areas plagued by lingering evil. Known by many as a Sheikah cultural object, there are some such as the dreaded Yiga outcasts who employ these charms for more aggressive purposes. Learn more about Talismans – how to obtain them, what they can do for you (or to you!), and how to add them to your campaign – below! . Talismans are a Consumable, and may occasionally be found for sale in towns with a particular tie to the Sheikah or some other cultural mysticism, or from charm peddlers in larger cities. A Talisman costs twice as much as a Material of the same Rank. Buyer Beware: Some Talismans may be a Trick Talisman being sold as a Talisman of another type. When a Trick Talisman would be activated in any way (typically using the methods to activate any other type of Talisman after application or use), the Talisman will simply burn away as usual and have no apparent effect… or did it…? While a Rank 0 Trick Talisman may fizzle away with little aplomb, higher Rank Talismans may more likely pose a danger to the user, often backfiring and inflicting a status effect on the user rather than the expected effect. Alternatively, a Hero with access to a teacher well versed in the art of Talisman Inscription or whose background is particularly closely connected to a culture which commonly practices Talisman use may learn to craft Talismans using the Sacred Scribe Feat.

When applied, the Talisman inflicts the chosen Status Effect to the target, after which it burns away in magical, harmless fire. If you use Sanguine Scribe with this Talisman, you must roll To-Hit as normal. Purifying Talisman . When crafted, select a single Status Effect. When applied to a character or unattended object, this Talisman activates when a roll is made to apply that status to the target this Talisman is attached to and provides (Rank + 1) to all of the target’s Guard Stats versus that attempt. The Talisman burns away in magical, harmless fire when it activates or during the next Long Rest, regardless if the Status successfully applies or fails. A character or Object may not benefit from more than 1 Talisman per round, and may not benefit from the same Talisman more than once until the next Short Rest. Searing Talisman . When this Talisman is crafted, select an Element or Physical Damage Type. On hit, this Talisman immediately explodes with a small blast of the element stored within, dealing (3 x (Rank + 1)) damage of the selected damage type to the target and destroying the Talisman. Summoning Talisman . While placed upon an unattended Small (or smaller) object, you may Spend (8 – Rank) Magic as a Standard Action to summon that object directly into your hand or into an empty space within (Rank + 1) spaces. For every Size Category above Small that the object is, the cost to summon the object is doubled, and the number of Talismans required to summon the object increases by 1. The summoned object may be returned to the location it was summoned from at no cost, as long as that space is empty. Summoned objects may contain other objects which fit within them, but may not contain living creatures, which are left behind when the object is summoned. Each Talisman on the object loses 1 Durability each time they are summoned, but not when returned. Tracking Talisman . While applied to a character or object, you may concentrate to learn the general direction and distance to this Talisman as a Standard Action. Alternatively, you may activate this Talisman as a Standard Action and Spend (Rank) Magic to gain a Knack for Perception Checks to discover the precise location of this Talisman, and you gain a bonus of (Rank) to this check, after which this Talisman burns away in harmless magical flames, regardless if the check was successful. When applying this Talisman, roll (Your Guile + Talisman Accuracy) vs Concentration; on hit, the target is unaware of this Talisman’s presence. The target may not use Evasion instead of Concentration for this effect. Any character may remove this Talisman as a Standard Action. If this Talisman is removed in this way or the character it is applied to becomes Helpless or the object it is applied to is destroyed, this Talisman disintegrates as if activated and you immediately receive a psychic pulse alerting you of precisely which Talisman was removed and the general direction and distrance to its last location. If this Talisman is removed by a character using Sacred Scribe, you are not alerted. This Talisman loses 1 durability for each day it is applied, after which it disintegrates and alerts you as if it was removed. Transport Talisman . This Talisman may be thrown without the use of the Talisman Tosser Feat, and throwing the Talisman is a Minor Action. During your next turn, you may Spend (16 – (Rank x 2)) Magic as a Movement Action to instantly teleport yourself to the space where the Talisman had landed (or the nearest empty space if the target space is not empty). The Talisman disintegrates upon being used to teleport or at the end of your next turn if unused. Teleporting using this Talisman does not end any effects which would normally be ended by Movement, although you may now be out of Range to perform certain Actions which have a Melee Range. You may not transport objects you cannot carry or other characters when teleporting using this Talisman. You may attempt to become hidden when activating this Talisman. Warding Talisman . This Talisman protects against evil spirits. When a foe moves within ((Rank + 1) x 2) Squares of the surface or object the Talisman is placed upon, it produces Bright Light in Burst 10 for (Rank + 1) Rounds and the Talisman burns away in harmless magical flames. Roll To-Hit the Concentration of each foe within Burst ((Rank + 1) x 2); on hit, they may not become Invisible or use the Phasing Passive Ability for (Rank + 1) Rounds. Additionally, the Talisman produces the effect of Farewell to Gibdos in Burst ((Rank + 1) x 2) with a Musical Power of (Rank + 1). This Talisman loses 1 Durability each day it is applied to an object, after which it burns away with no effect. At Rank 5, this Talisman never loses Durability. When this Talisman activates, you receive a psychic pulse which makes you aware of the activation and exactly which Talisman activated, but not the circumstances. Trick Talisman . When this Talisman is crafted, select a Status Effect. When the user of this Talisman attempts to activate it in any way, the Talisman disintegrates as expected. The Talisman rolls To-Hit the user’s Concentration; on hit, apply the chosen Status Effect to the user of this Talisman. This Talisman has an Accuracy of (3 + Rank) to apply its Status Effect. This is not affected by any ability that would normally affect Talisman Accuracy (such as Sacred Scribe). This Talisman may be crafted without using any Monster Parts. A Trick Talisman crafted this way has no apparent effect when activated, and simply leaves an inky black smudge where it was applied. This smudge is difficult to clean off. Art by Firox . ",

Every year, the people here make and fly kites bearing special Talismans which grant a blessing of protection over the whole village. The Festival lasts for seven days, each day a different group flies their kites. However, today – the first day of the festival – dangerous mischief unfolds. Someone has replaced some of the Talismans with Trick Talismans! Innocent prank or malicious act, people are being hurt as the Talismans activate and afflict their victims with terrible conditions, and there are to be 6 more days of this! Can the party find the tampered Talismans, the culprit, and the motive before more people are injured? Or will they have to convince the elders to cancel the sacred festival this year, and face the evils they have staved off for all this time? . Wolf Tickets for Snake Oil . Upon entering the town, the party is confronted by a rather boisterous merchant vending wares from a stall. The wares on offer are all clearly extremely high quality and authentic, although the prices seem far too low to be real for such rare and well-crafted wares! The party may discover from their own experience, or overhear from the townsfolk rumors that the goods sold by the merchant have seemingly vanished before they could be made of any use, and many suspect foul play, although no evidence of theft or accomplice has been found in investigation. Will the party discover the method of the thefts, possibly that the tags on the goods are Summoning Talismans being used to magically recover the items for resale? Will they be able to find the charlatan to regain the money now that the unscrupulous merchant has seemingly disappeared? And wasn’t the town’s sacred Pedestal right there just a second ago? . Sealing the Immortal Evil . Talismans have long been used to consecrate holy sites and to ward off evil spirits… but some Evil must be contained rather than expelled. The Village you are visiting trembles under the looming shadow of a rampant demonic beast, one which plagues the land and cannot be defeated by mundane means. A brave monk – perhaps the only survivor of their temple’s sect – has devised a plan to defeat the monster once and for all: to seal the beast with a powerful Talisman, locking it away forever! The only problem is the monk cannot leave the town unprotected to gather the resources they need. Of particular importance are the specific sealing prayers to bind the beast. The Heroes must seek out the lost records of the ritual in the ruined temples and shrines in the nearby area, all while avoiding the dark juggernaut they seek to defeat, and ultimately set and spring the trap and lock the monster away!

    "content": "Writing your first session’s adventure can be a daunting, exhilarating task. You may have read, watched, or played in some great adventures before, and feel that you need (or just want) to rise to meet their quality bar. But the truth of it is, the best first sessions are pretty simple, and get you into the game quickly. Your goal is not to write the next Tolkien-esque epic, with a living world and a complex, intertwined plot – rather, your goal is to have a fun game with some friends. As such, we recommend you have a relatively simple problem for your players to solve in their initial session, with a villain to thwart, a few obstacles to overcome, and a solid moment of “heroic success” for the players at the end. If you already know what you want your campaign to be about, you can sprinkle in leads and hints towards that greater goal in your first session – perhaps the villain was working for a bigger bad guy, or his minions are whispering about a great evil coming over the horizon. In any first session, both the players and the GM are still getting their feet wet. Even players who are experienced with the system will still be getting a feel for their new characters, and the GM might be getting used to new players at their table. In either case, newcomers are still learning the rules, no matter how much they’ve read the rulebook before. As such, we recommend your initial session have “a little bit of everything,” if you can. This will let your players see their Heroes in different lights, and have an opportunity to try out everything they can be and do – and for you to see what kinds of activities your players enjoy most, so you can try to do more of those things in the future. | Have a combat against some simple Rank 0 or Rank 1 foes, so everyone can get a feel for how the Heroes work in a fight. (We suggest this initial fight be against a number of foes equal to the number of Heroes, and consist of at least two different types of foes.) | Have a social situation, so players can roleplay as their Heroes, and exercise their more social-oriented Traits. | Have an obstacle that can’t just be walked around, such as a broken bridge, locked door, or heavy block and switch. This lets the Heroes stretch their muscles an their minds, and use their Spells, Techniques, and Tools to solve problems. | . If you know what kinds of Heroes your players are bringing to the table, you can tailor the obstacles in your adventure to better match (and be bested by) their skillset. For instance, if one of your players’ Heroes is a wizard who knows much about the ways of nature, perhaps the ‘broken bridge’ instead becomes overgrown with poisonous thorns. Remember, one of the main goals of a first session is to get players to want to return for the next session! Make sure you reward your Heroes for accomplishing their task and completing their first adventure. This reward, much like the obstacles they overcame, should come in a variety of forms: not only loot (weapons, materials, rupees), but also the gratitude of the people they’ve helped, and the anger of the villains they’ve thwarted.

So, don’t be surprised when someone tries to do something you hadn’t planned for! That’s part of the fun. If you don’t know how to handle something, we suggest saying the following: “You can try it! Give me a Trait roll, and let’s see how it works out.” If the roll is sufficiently high, let the crazy plan work! (For a first session with fresh Heroes, we recommend a Difficulty Check of 10 for reasonable ideas, 13 for the kinda-out-there ideas, and 16 for the truly ridiculous ideas.) . One of the most important tactics for keeping your players entertained, as a GM… is to be entertaining. Put on a show, and put some energy into it! Put some oomph into your depiction of NPCs, giving them voices, accents, quirks, and habits. Describe the actions of your monsters in combat with gusto – don’t just say “the Bokoblin takes 5 damage and is defeated,” say “you slam the Bokoblin into the dirt, burying his head, leaving his legs kicking for a moment as he tries in vain to pull himself free.” .

Maybe they hear rumors of different problems in the world, and they can choose which one to track down and solve next. Alternatively, perhaps they have just one lead to follow up on, but they have a clear variety of ways they can follow up on it. By having this choice, you’re giving the players something to talk about between the end of the first session, and the beginning of the next – and that helps keep them engaged and focused on your campaign, eager to see what happens next! (And be sure to remind them to tell you what they want to do for the next session, so you can plan it ahead of time.) . Take notes about what your players did (and did not) enjoy in your first session. Maybe some plot elements weren’t as engaging as you thought they’d be; maybe one particular bandit was a favorite punching-bag, or performed surprisingly well. You can bring those things that the players loved back in future sessions, and you can avoid the things that didn’t work well. Once you’ve got some experience under your belt, you can start making larger, more ambitious plans for your sessions and your campaign overall. One of our favorite frameworks for building a session is the “Five Room Dungeon” method. We might get further into using that framework for making fun sessions in a future article, but for now, know that it’s a useful tool for structuring a session, adventure, or even a whole campaign.

June is LGBT Pride month! And Zelda games have often included subtle nods and inclusions of the LGBTQ+ experience – sometimes well, but often with missteps. As Reclaim the Wild is a tabletop game, where you are the story’s author, you have the opportunity to do better. Your table can be a safe haven for LGBTQ+ players, and you can include their story and have positive representation of them. So in this article, we’re going to present advice of a different sort: ideas and encouragement for including characters and players of all types, but especially trans characters and players, in your Reclaim the Wild games. This article is split into two sections; first covering some general tabletop advice for including diverse experiences, and then dispensing advice specific to Reclaim the Wild and the trans experience. This is a subject near and dear to my heart; while I am not trans, several of my friends are, and their contributions were essential to Reclaim’s development. Check out the advice below! . ",

    "content": "I want to be clear at the outset, and reiterate: I am not an expert on the trans experience, nor am I myself trans. (If you have the opportunity to discuss this with actual experts, I encourage you to do so, with an open mind and an open notepad.) I’ve done the best I could in researching this article, including seeking out the experiences and perspectives of trans people. Any missteps in this article are mine alone, and come from my own inexperience and limited knowledge. Nothing in this article – or any article! – is intended to supplant or shout down what the actual people at your gaming table have to say, especially not any trans persons you are playing with. Every table, and every person, is different – and it’s up to you, as the GM, to account for what everyone’s comfortable with, and to tailor your game to meet those needs. The trans experience is not a universal, monolithic thing. There are many ways to explore it – more than any one author or article can enumerate. There are people who are genderfluid, non-conforming, or who express their identity in unique ways. Their experiences are as valid as anyone else’s, even if we don’t touch on them in this article. Above all else, you should speak with your gaming group. Make it clear that you intend to run a game that’s positive and inclusive towards LGBTQ+ characters, and that you’ll brook no bigotry on the subject. Talk to your trans players (if you have any) about what aspects of their experience they might want to see included in the game, if any. A Reference Point . Whether or not you or anyone at your gaming table is trans, you should still include transgender persons in your game world. For reference, in our world, it’s estimated that roughly 355 out of every 100,000 people identify as trans in some form – or roughly one-third of one percent. (Source) To not include them makes your game world less realistic and immersive, and also prevents you from being able to make the full breadth of interesting characters and stories that your game can accommodate. While “one third of one percent” may not seem like a huge number, it’s about on-par with rolling an 18 on a 3d6 (which has a 0.46% chance of happening). However, while you certainly can randomly roll to determine an NPC’s identity, this can be a slow process when you’re trying to make a new NPC on the fly. Indeed, if one solely relies on a die roll to guarantee representation, then you might revert to your biases when you don’t use the dice (such as when you’re put on the spot). As such, you cannot solely rely on random dice rolls – you need to take an active role in being inclusive. Be Actively Inclusive . As such, it’s important to be actively inclusive. This can take a variety of forms, but in general, it means that you, as the GM, specifically try to include otherwise-marginalized groups whenever the opportunity to do so arises. For instance, if you’re creating a new town for your players to visit, you’ve got an opportunity to include a few trans people – or people with disabilities, who are neurodivergent, who are of color, or who otherwise do not look, act, or come from circumstances like you yourself do. Remember that being inclusive in this way doesn’t mean the NPC(s) in question have to be about their differences – in fact, they probably shouldn’t be, unless you have an interesting story to tell that involves those unique aspects of the character. For instance, whether the town’s mayor uses a wheelchair or not, she’s probably more concerned with the monsters in the sewers and the bandits on the road, than with explaining what her legs can and cannot do. Similarly, if the merchant they speak to about the recent bandit attacks is trans, it may only come up because the GM mentions it, and not because the merchant needs to expound on the subject to these (amicable, yet heavily-armed) strangers. So long as you keep being active, and varied, in the wide variety of types of peoples you’re including, you’ll find you make a more colorful, interesting, and representative cast of major and minor NPCs – the no-name barkeeps, the rival adventuring parties, the cackling villains, and the campaign world’s important historical figures. Villains and Bigotry . If, as a GM, you decide to be actively inclusive, and you have a player who is playing a trans, disabled, neurodivergent, or otherwise ‘different’ character, it may be tempting to make your villain a bigot – to have an irrational distaste for people different from themselves. This can be fun in some ways, such as when your Heroes are able to punch the villain in their stupid, stupid face. However, as with everything in this article, it’s important to talk to your players about whether, and how, such a villain might express their bigotry. If you do want to have a bigoted villain, we recommend minimizing the slurs and bigoted statements they use – even a single bigoted statement from a villain can ring in a player’s mind for a long, long time, giving heroes extra motivation to seek out and defeat such a villain. Using more can cross the line from “this character is a bigot” to “the person behind this character is using them as a mouthpiece”. (One possible middle ground here is to simply mention that they say “something bigoted”, without actually using the hateful words.) . We also recommend you not actually have the villain actually include their bigotry in their evil schemes. Again, this can very easily cross a line from “fantasy villain” to “you, the person at the table, being an actual villain”, and can easily be a slippery slope. ",

    "title": "Reclaim-specific Advice",
    "content": "Zelda games have featured a few characters and thematic elements that can easily be utilized in exploring trans themes. All of these thematic elements have pros and cons to consider – so, as always, be sure to discuss their use with your whole table before you seek to utilize them in this way. One thing to note before we dive in, though: this list of ways to explore the trans experience in Reclaim the Wild is not exhaustive, nor is it required. The world of Zelda is huge, replete with magic and full of things that are never fully explained. The same may be true for trans characters in your campaign, whether they are Heroes or NPCs – they may have simply transitioned prior to the events of the game, and their method of transition may be as complete and unimpeachable as you like. Even if you decide to specify how a character transitioned, it is perfectly valid to then say, “…and it’s no big deal.” . Impa’s Disguise . Arguably the origin of trans stories in the Zelda mythos, the magical ability to change one’s appearance was key in the story of Ocarina of Time – allowing Zelda to appear as the masculine character Sheik. As such, it’s natural to use it as a way to explore changing one’s sexual presentation. However, keep in mind that as a permanent measure, Impa’s Disguise is deeply imperfect. It requires the user to sink Magic into the spell to keep it active, making a Hero less effective than their fellows. It can also be rudely pierced by a Lens of Truth spell, or even by physical contact – allowing others to see past how the character wants to present themselves, without their consent. Now, this may be a valuable opportunity to face forces that would try to relieve you of your chosen identity, and to have the need to put in additional work to present as your chosen identity – but it also leaves a character’s identity exceptionally vulnerable, to anything from wizards to an innocent bump while walking down the street. To that end, we only recommend Impa’s Disguise as a way to temporarily or tentatively alter one’s presentation, or to offer the opportunity to suffer, and the surmount, an opposing force to one’s identity. More experienced trans characters will almost certainly want a more permanent solution, and players who want to experience ‘how life should be’ moreso than ‘how life unfortunately can be’ may wish to use other options as well. Masks &amp; the Song of Healing . Masks are one of the most potent and mysterious types of Magical Tool available in the Zelda mythos, and as a thematic element, their use stretches back thousands of years. However, it’s important to note that their use in exploring the trans experience can be both incredibly freeing, and deeply problematic. In Zelda games, and particularly in Reclaim the Wild, wearing a Mask of the Healed Soul can transform a Hero’s body into that of another race – from Hylian to Zora, or from Demon to Fairy, for example. Nothing in the canonical games suggests that the masks also can change a person’s physical sex, though one imagines the possibility comes up at least with members of races of monolithic genders (specifically the Gerudo and Gorons). In short, this means that a Mask could provide a player with a means to change their sex, whether or not the mask also changes their race (IE if a Hylian wears a Hylian’s Mask). While using a Mask for this method of transformation has some benefits, it also has several drawbacks. On the plus side, as a non-permanent change, the Mask can be taken off as easily as it’s applied, allowing the person using it to change their physical sex when they choose. Wearing a Mask also prevents others from easily seeing through the change; unlike a casting of Impa’s Disguise, the Lens of Truth spell won’t pierce the change. Using a Mask this way also allows the story of a person’s trans experience to have pitfalls, struggles, and opportunities to fail. While more permanent than most magical means, a Mask can slip, or be ripped off. If you and your fellow players are alright with that, then you can turn this negative aspect of a Mask into a positive – an opportunity to tell cathartic stories, where obstacles are overcome and one’s identity is (if you’ll pardon the name drop) reclaimed. Negatively, however, the experience of being trans may not be akin to putting on a mask to cover up what one was – rather, it’s more like removing a mask that one had always been wearing. To that end, using a Mask in this manner has a variety of unfortunate implications, most importantly being that the person in question is “covering up” or “hiding” their truth, rather than fully revealing it to the world. To that end, one alternative use for Masks might be to combine them with the Song of Healing (or some more targeted, specific variant thereof). By playing this Song for the trans character in question, their assigned sex might turn into a Mask, revealing their true selves. You may want to rename this item to reflect this change in perspective – a “Mask of Old Assumptions”, perhaps. As an additional advantage, this may allow the character in question to either utilize this new Mask themselves – if they aren’t fully sure of their new form and presentation, for practical reasons, or just to hand it to someone else who wants to try it on. Keeping one’s old form at-hand can also enable a character to, quite literally, “put the mask back on”. This might be used when in the company of those who aren’t ready to accept their new, true form, or whom they are not ready to face as their true selves yet – be they family, friends, or villains who don’t yet know a Hero’s true face. This can be a bittersweet boon, and a potent reminder of (and roleplaying opportunity to express) what one has gained, lost, and changed, in one’s transition. Finally, having one’s old Mask also allows the character the opportunity to destroy the Mask, providing a moment of catharsis – and making an irreversible, undeniable step into their new identity. We suggest that this not require more magical work to do; simply throwing the Mask to the ground (and maybe giving it a good stomp or two) should do the trick. Some characters may wish to impart more ceremony to the action, or take time to reflect on their former circumstances and say farewell – while others might simply drop the mask behind them and walk away. Playing Certain Races . Perhaps uniquely among all Nintendo properties, the Zelda world ties gender and race together pretty tightly. There are several Races in Reclaim the Wild that might bring matters of sex, gender, and presentation to the fore. (Before we begin, note that here, we mean “sex”, “male”, or “female” to speak of one’s biology, and “gender”, “man”, “woman”, “masculine”, “feminine”, or “presentation” to mean how one lives their life and presents themselves to others. The language is imperfect, and still in flux; this is my attempt to understand it, parse it, and give advice regarding it.) . First and foremost are the Gerudo, famous for their paucity of males, and their cities that allow only women to enter. Those few Gerudo raised as men face both a wealth of unearned privilege, and a heavy weight of expectation – they are seen as kings of their race, with both power and responsibility thrust upon them, whether they like it or not. Meanwhile, Gerudo women are seen as both desirable, and frightening, to the Hylian men that dominate many cities throughout Hyrule; they are forced to make their way in foreign lands to find mates, jobs, and housing. Imagine, then, what a Gerudo man might be like, who was once assumed to be a woman. Would his fellow Gerudo see him as a usurper, trying to claim the wealth that their society feels is entitled to Gerudo men? Or the opposite, a Gerudo woman once considered a man by her people – is she abdicating responsibility, or giving up the nigh-limitless power her people handed her? In either case, what might a Gerudo’s perspective be on other trans peoples’ stories? . On the opposite end of the spectrum are the Gorons, a race known for their curious rock-based biology and seemingly all-masculine composition. Even the Gerudo, focused as they are on a person’s gender and their role in society, often don’t know what to make of them – are they men, are they without gender, or are they something else entirely? We’ve never had a truly definitive answer, and the answer may never be fully known. But by playing a Goron, you may take on those masculine aspects, or present in a more gender-neutral way – or perhaps you might break new ground, as it were, by being among the first Gorons to present as a woman. Then there are the Subrosians, unknowable but adorable, fully cloaked and never seen. Given this, a Subrosian’s gender can only be known by how they present themselves: a Subrosian woman wearing a cute ribbon, or a Subrosian man speaking in a rough, masculine way. Many Subrosians do neither, either as a conscious choice, or simply because the question of gender is one they’ve never considered (or may even be wholly unaware of). Perhaps for the Subrosians, one’s gender is only as permanent as the accessories and affectations one uses to indicate it. (After all, even a Subrosian’s name might change as their hobby or job changes!) . Finally, that brings us to the Demons, a race known for its ability to transform from one form to another, and back again – first presenting as humanoid, then as monstrous. Nothing requires that both forms need be of the same sex or gender! You may even have multiple humanoid and demonic forms, if you want to have multiple presentations available to you (with GM permission). This may make Demons intriguing for people who wish to experience multiple genders, not be tied to a single presentation, or otherwise emphasize a multi-faceted nature. However, given how Demons can be ostracized from some communities in Reclaim, and how real-life trans people are sometimes ostracized from their communities, we want to encourage and remind you to not accidentally demonize trans people, whether or not they be Demons. By playing a member of one of these races, a person who is exploring their sexuality or gender presentation – be they trans, gay, asexual, dysphoric, or however they might be – can further explore both their struggles, and their joys. Be doubly sure to speak with your GM and your fellow players, though, to know what struggles you want to explore, which to set aside, and which you’d rather leave in the dustbin of history. ",

    "content": "The nature of a Treasure Chest’s trap varies greatly from one Chest to the next, depending on who trapped it, why they decided to do that, and the theming of the Chest’s location. However, here are some quick rules of thumb for designing traps for your treasure: . | In general, the higher-rank the Chest, the more dangerous or deadly you can make its trap. A Rank 1 Chest’s trap should be a hindrance, but unlikely to kill someone; a Rank 4 Chest’s trap, however, could very well be deadly. | Simply causing damage is boring, and easily fixed outside of an otherwise-dangerous situation. Consider inflicting statuses for a long duration, Burning resources, relocating the Heroes, or summoning monsters. Particularly dangerous traps might do several of these things, giving the Heroes a real mess to deal with. | If the trap requires some kind of To-Hit roll, use a Weapon Accuracy of 3, and an Accuracy Trait of (Chest’s Rank x 2). | . While a full catalogue of Treasure Chest traps is beyond the scope of this article, here are some ideas for just a few of the misfortunes that might befall unwary treasure-hunters: . | The chest contains a mechanism that jabs a poisoned needle into whoever first opens it.

The looter’s friends must either find a safe way down, or take the plunge themselves to follow. | The Chest is full of a large amount of pressurized water. On its own, this just Soaks any nearby Heroes when opened. However, this makes dealing with upcoming electrical foes and traps much more painful. | The Treasure Chest is actually a special type of Like Like, and sucks the offending opener inside! The Heroes (both inside and outside the Treasure Like) will need to struggle through an Extended Check to break out the poor treasure-hunter, while the Treasure Like continually drains their wallet and their health. | The chest contains a spark of energy from the Dark World.

Gemstones: The Gemstones found in a Treasure Chest follow the same rules as other Materials (below) for determining their quantity. However, the type of Gemstone is more often based on the Chest’s surroundings and theme. For instance, finding Rubies in a Fire Temple, or Emeralds in a chest deep in the Lost Woods, would not be surprising in the slightest. Materials: Chests typically contain (2d6 / 2) units of Material, of (Chest’s Rank). The Materials in a Chest may occasionally be a Rank higher or lower than the Chest itself – if the Materials are of a lower Rank, then there should be more (2d6); if they’re of a Higher rank, there should be fewer (2d6 / 4). Rupees: The amount of Rupees in a chest can vary, but is typically (Chest’s Rank x 20 x 2d6). If a Chest is especially meant to hold lots of Rupees, this could go as high as (Chest’s Rank x 50 x 2d6). When determining the exact details of loot found in a Treasure Chest, don’t be afraid to ask your players what they might want! You don’t have to give it to them exactly as they request, either – take it as a suggestion, not a requirement. ",

Some chests, like Big Chests, might be more difficult, or even impossible, to open without the proper key. Chests that only open by completing a puzzle might also not be pickable, as they lack a traditional lock to even attempt to fiddle with. Sometimes, Heroes might be so desperate for materials that they want to deconstruct a Treasure Chest. Deconstructing a Treasure Chest requires that the Chest be unlocked and empty, and also requires the use of a Forge – so material-hungry Heroes will have to carry the empty box back to town. Treasure Chests can’t be placed in a Hero’s Pack, but they can be loaded on Wagons (consuming one slot of the wagon’s inventory), or carried in two hands. When deconstructed, a Small Chest grants 1 unit of Metal of its Rank, and 2 units of Wood of its Rank. (A Big Chest grants twice this amount.) . ",

    "content": "New Enchantment: Tutoring . Uses: Special, see below Effect: This enchantment allows the wielder of a weapon to temporarily use Spells or Techniques. The enchanter chooses which combinations of valid Spells and Techniques can be granted by the Tutoring enchantment, as long as the total token cost does not exceed (3 * (Rank / 2), rounded up) tokens. The Spells and Techniques you can add to this Enchant is determined by your GM; see the section “Determining Valid Spells and Techniques for Tutoring” below for guidelines. | ENCHANTMENT RANK | TOKENS GRANTED | . | 0 | 0 | . | 1 | 3 | . | 2 | 3 | . | 3 | 6 | . | 4 | 6 | . | 5 | 9 | . The wielder of a weapon must still meet the requirements to “learn” and use a Spell or Technique, though they can use the other abilities in the Tutoring enchantment to qualify. Here are some examples: . | If a Tutoring Weapon has Bombos, then the user must know at least 1 Fire Spell before they can use it. | A wand with Fairy’s Light and Great Fairy’s Light will allow the use of both Spells, even if the user doesn’t normally know any Healing Spells. | A Hylian cannot use Goron Goroll with a Tutoring Weapon. | . The Tutoring Weapon must be used with the Spell or Technique. Even if the Spell has nothing to do with the Weapon (such as Yarna’s Vortex), the weapon must be held in hand and loses Durability if the Spell or Technique is used. If a Spell or Technique allows use of multiple weapons (such as with Serpent’s Fangs), the Tutoring Weapon must be one of the weapons used. The Gem used by this Enchantment depends on which Spells and Techniques are desired. If only Spells or Techniques without an associated Element (such as Wind-up Strike or Wizrobe’s Wave) will be used, any Gem will do. If any Spell or Technique has an Elemental aspect, then the proper type of Gem will be used as shown in the following table: . | ELEMENT | GEMSTONE | . | Dark | Onyx | . | Earth | Emerald | . | Fire | Ruby | . | Ice | Sapphire | . | Shock | Topaz | . | Water | Opal | .

    "title": "Determining Valid Spells and Techniques for Tutoring",
    "content": "The Enchantment text does not specify which Spells and Techniques can be used for Tutoring. This is because the value of the Tutoring enchant may depend on how restricted it is. In the following sections you will see guidelines on how to determine which abilities can be used. Knowledge Restriction . The most basic restriction is “what the Enchanter already knows”. However, this may overly restrict things because the marginal benefit of more than one PC may not be worth the opportunity cost of lacking a different enchantment. For instance, if the enchanter already knows Spin Attack, how valuable would Spin Attack be to the rest of the party? . A more loose restriction would allow the Enchanter to work with someone else for determining the Spells and Techniques. This at least broadens the pool so that the rest of the party – as well as any helpful and knowledgeable NPCs – can contribute to the enchantments. An even more loose restriction would allow the Enchanter to use the Spells and Techniques that they – or their helper’s – either know, or qualify for. This for instance will allow an Enchanter to create a Bombos Tutoring Weapon when they know at least 1 Fire Spell. The loosest restriction is to allow any player-usable Spells and Techniques (or even those used by Monsters) to be used for this enchantment. This can of course cause issues due to having such a wide selection that will expand with additional supplements and articles. A restriction tighter than the basic one would be to have individual gems have specific Spells or Techniques. For instance, a rank 1 “Ruby of Zola’s Fireball” could be among the gems found in a pile of loot, and it could only be used to provide Zola’s Fireball if used as the main gem for Tutoring. This can be a good means to teach Monster-unique abilities, such as “Ruby of Fire Breath” falling from a Dodongo. The tightest restriction is to not allow players to craft this Enchantment, but to simply allow it to be bought or found. This makes it easy for the GM to control just how many Tutoring Spells and Techniques the players have access to at one time. However, be careful, as some players may find themselves unwilling to use certain items that cannot easily be crafted or bought. (See here) . Thematic Restriction . Another aspect of Spells and Techniques is to determine whether they “make sense” to be attached to a certain type of weapon – or any weapon at all. This is of course dependent on the tone of the game – if your game takes place in a video game-esque world, or one with more common magic or technology, then it’s fine to have odd interactions (like a Long Gun with Greater Fairy’s Light). But if your world is more down to Earth or serious, these may not match. The easiest to allow are those Spells and Techniques that deal damage, as they interact with a weapon’s statistics other than Durability. Typical examples are: . | The Yiga Windcleaver weapon. The sidebar in Ravage the Wild helped inspire this Enchantment, after all! | The Bombos, Ether, and Quake Medallions could be considered Tutoring Enchantments for the Master Sword. | The Fire Emblem tomes can be considered Spellbooks with the Tutoring Enchantment. | . Non-damaging Spells and Techniques may make sense with some types of Weapons and not others, depending on the above factors. For instance: . | The Sand Rod can just be a regular Rod with Terrakinesis. | Pegasus Boots can just be regular Boots with Tantari’s Jump. | A Gate with Zelda’s Phantom. | . ",

Even after a thousand years, they’ll still be trying to fulfill the goals of those they’ve lost, or to resurrect them entirely; time is no factor in their immortal minds.

Weapon Spirits’ interests in new cultures varies from individual to individual, but for those who face decades or centuries of disuse between outings, it can seem pointless to bother remembering the details. For those that frequently interact with new people, on the other hand, they might find it more worthwhile to put effort into meeting people on their own level–even going so far as to use Impa’s Disguise to facilitate interactions without being seen as frightening, or as ‘merely an object.’ . There are two quintessential ways a Weapon Spirit can participate in battle. The first is inhabiting their Weapon Form, supporting another Hero in their trials. In this way, the Weapon may allow the wielder to use techniques they don’t normally know, or bestow supportive effects–spells and techniques used by the Spirit. Alternatively, the Weapon Spirit may choose to stand on the frontlines themselves, wielding their Weapon Form. This lacks the natural synergy of weapon and wielder, but allows them to make their own story and support their allies in other ways. Ultimately, a Weapon Spirit will likely use a mix of both methods across their lifetime.

Weapon Spirit Names, despite what one might expect at first, share little in common with the name of the weapon itself.

    "content": "It may seem obvious on the face of it, but a Weapon Spirit’s existence is defined by their being the personal incarnation of a weapon. What isn’t immediately obvious, though, is how this can affect the spirit’s mentality and views on various matters. That a Weapon Spirit would be more comfortable with and quicker to suggest violence as a solution is only the most readily apparent such instance. For example, a weapon is constantly in close proximity to its wielder, and invading an enemy’s personal space is inherently necessary to attacking them. As such, Weapon Spirits can often develop a distinct lack of concept of personal space, moving in closer than others are comfortable to get their points across, or just as a casual gesture. Another way being a weapon can affect the spirit is their concept of purpose and fate. A weapon belongs to others, and is always a tool of violence, whether to attack or defend. For many, this translates as a firm loyalty and acknowledgement that violence is a part of life, though how far one goes in each is up to the individual. Others, however, may question this–and question why they, themselves, have to exist as part of it. Rebellion is not impossible, just rare. ",

Witches have been a small, recurring part in the Zelda franchise since its inception, primarily taking the form of an old woman who sells Link restorative potions. Part of Link’s journey from the very first game onwards, it’s not unfair to say that many players would never have rescued Zelda if not for these old crones’ assistance. However, there are other witches that various Links interact with, such as Maple and Irene, who take a more active role in the world. They both help and hinder Link in his quest, as they bounce around on their own adventures. Of course, these witches can only move so quickly thanks to their signature conveyance: the Witch’s Broom. And in this article, we’ll talk about what a Witch’s Broom can do in your own Reclaim the Wild game, as well as how to craft your very own personalized, customized, souped-up Broom! . ",

Further, only trained Witches know the mystic secrets to crafting their own Brooms. Whether your Hero begins their career as a Witch, or learns the secrets of witchcraft later in their journey, their ability to ride and craft Brooms is represented with the Broomcraft Feat, below. New Feat: Broomcraft . 3 Tokens Requirement: Quest Reward or GM Approval Only Effect: You can now craft Witch’s Brooms. If you are using the Master Mode rules for Witch’s Broom proficiency, you can now pilot a Witch’s Broom without suffering the Slick Terrain Penalty at the end of your turn. Starting with a Broom . Witch’s Brooms are relatively expensive to craft (see below), so a player cannot start the game with one without a GM’s permission. Keep in mind, however, that many a young Witch’s training ends with a quest to craft their very own Broom, providing both a strong reason to not begin with a Broom, and a potent plot-hook to get the young Witch out of their teacher’s house and on the road to adventure. More experienced Witches may have suffered some hardship that ruined their previous Broom, or may be trying to ‘blend in’ with more mundane people, and thus have left their previous Broom behind. If the GM does decide to allow a player to begin with a Broom, we recommend keeping the Broom to either Rank 1 or Rank 0, depending on the character and their circumstances. We also recommend replacing one of the character’s starting Tools with their starting Broom. ",

(This means you can’t cast Spells while on your Broom, unless you also pick up the “Dragoon” Feat!) . Brooms can also be harmed in the thick of combat, or by cruel foes who would try to break an unattended Broom over their knee. Brooms have ((Rank + 1) x 4) Durability. Brooms do not have Guard Stats of their own; while being piloted, they use their Rider’s Guard Stats (Concentration, Evasion, and Vitality). Whenever a Broom sustains damage during combat, it loses 1 Durability. Brooms, being made of Wood, are Vulnerable to Fire; if a Broom is struck by Fire damage, it instead loses 2 Durability (and if set On Fire, it loses 2 Durability at the start of your turn). Unlike the Master Cycle, Brooms do not lose Durability from being used as a means of transportation. Brooms can also be safely used for sweeping and general cleaning purposes, of course, without harming their Durability. However, any use besides that (excepting any use that directly stems from the Broom’s Personal Touches, below) will consume one unit of the Broom’s Durability. Repairing Brooms . If a Broom is damaged, you can repair it, so long as it hasn’t reached 0 Durability. During a Short or Extended Rest, you may consume one Monster Part, Cloth, or Wood, restoring (Material’s Rank + 1) Durability. You can also use a Gem, which restores ((Material’s Rank + 1) x 4) Durability. You may only consume one item per Rest this way. ",

    "title": "Crafting a Broom",
    "content": "For many Witches, crafting their own Broom is an important rite of passage. A young Witch’s teacher will typically require the youth to procure the materials and construct the Broom all by themselves – a kind of final thesis statement, demonstrating everything the young Witch has learned. To craft a Broom, you must spend an Extended Rest (typically, a full day) in the act of crafting, casting, and concentrating. The exact methods and principles of Broom-crafting are closely held secrets, and vary from one Witch to the next – making it a great opportunity to explore how your Witch does things, and what that says about them. Crafting a Broom does not require a Forge, but it does require a heatsource, like Cooking does. You might use a campfire, a house’s kitchen, or yes, even a Forge. Crafting a Broom consumes: . | 1 Unit of Wood | 3 Gems (of any type, mix-and-match) | 5 Units of Cloth | 7 Monster Parts | . …all of the same Rank. This creates a Witch’s Broom of that Rank. (You can, of course, use higher-Ranked Materials, but the Broom will be of the lowest-Ranked unit of Material used in its construction.) . The Rank of Materials you can use to craft a Broom is limited by your Enchanting Trait: you may only use Materials of a Rank equal to (Enchanting / 2) or less. Deconstructing a Broom . Brooms can be deconstructed, much like most things. This might come up if your Heroes defeat an evil Witch, but don’t want to use her ill-gotten Broom; or if they make a new, spiffier Broom, and want to dispose of last year’s model. Deconstructing a Broom returns 1 Gem, 2 Cloth, and 3 Monster Parts, of the Broom’s Rank. Upgrading a Broom . Brooms can be upgraded, allowing you to improve their abilities and alter their Personal Touches (below). Upgrading a Broom is mechanically the same as creating a new Broom, and deconstructing the old Broom at the same time: you consume Materials to create your new Broom at the new Rank, and you receive the Materials of the Broom’s old Rank from deconstructing it. Personal Touches . When you craft a Broom, you also decide on its Personal Touches, much like when you build a Castle using the rules found in Rebuild the Wild. Brooms may have up to (Rank) many Personal Touches. Each Personal Touch may only be taken once, unless otherwise stated. When you upgrade a Broom, you may change any existing Personal Touches it had, in addition to adding new Personal TOuches based on its Rank. Below are just a handful of the Personal Touches your Broom might have – but don’t be afraid to discuss your own ideas for Personal Touches with your GM! . | Attuned: This Broom is specifically attuned to you. Treat this as if the Broom had the “Loyal” Enchantment on it, of a Rank equal to the Broom’s Rank. Further, anyone who does not have your explicit permission to pilot this Broom will suffer the “Slick Terrain Penalty” as if they did not have the Broomcraft Feat. | Clean Sweep: During an Extended Rest, you may take a few minutes to use your Broom as an actual cleaning instrument, sweeping up your immediate surroundings. This produces a single Critter, based on the terrain you’re in, of a Rank up to (the Broom’s Rank). This does not prevent you from seeking out or harvesting other Materials during that Extended Rest. | Cupholders: Your Broom has (Rank / 2) cupholders, or other small containers that can easily be accessed while riding on your Broom. Treat these as Belt slots, accessible to any person(s) currently riding the Broom or otherwise adjacent to it. | Enchanted, Dark: As a Minor action, this Broom’s rider may command it to exude acrid black smoke from its bristles, covering the squares it traverses for the remainder of the turn. Perception checks made through the smoke take a (Rank) penalty, and light sources within the smoke have their Rank (or radius) reduced by (Rank). | Enchanted, Light: This Broom is enchanted with light. It may exude light as a Lantern of its Rank would, in either a Burst or a Cone; it may also leave a thin line of light behind it as it flies through the sky. The Broom’s rider may change the light’s shape, its color, dim it (reducing its Rank temporarily), direct it, or completely turn it on or off, as a Minor Action. | Glamoured: The Broom is enchanted with a glamour, changing the appearance of itself and anyone riding on it. It might look like a cloud, to hide in the sky; or it might look like a flying saucer, to really draw attention. The Broom’s pilot may activate and deactivate this glamour as a Minor Action. You may select this Personal Touch more than once, each time selecting a different glamour to add to the Broom’s repertoire. | Room for More: Your Broom takes up an additional (Rank / 2) squares, and thus has room for (Rank / 2) additional Creatures to sit upon it. This might be in the form of a motorcycle-style sidecar, a basket hanging beneath it, or the broom may simply be longer than normal. Regardless, only one person (the Pilot) may be in control of the Broom at a time. | Shrinkable: This Broom can shrink and grow back to size on command. (This does not allow its pilot to shrink with it, nor any items kept in cupholders.) It can be safely placed within a Pack’s Key Items pouch, rather than in the Tools pouch. It can also easily be used when the Hero is under the effects of any shrinking effects that the Broom was not also affected by. | Sorcerer’s Broom: Your Broom is capable of moving, acting, and maybe even thinking, all on its own. At Ranks 0-1, it has Instinctual intelligence, capable of following you and reacting to stimuli, but unable to follow commands. At Ranks 2-3, it possesses Limited intelligence, and can follow short commands and perform some simple tasks on its own, rather like a dog. At Ranks 4-5, the Broom has Rational intelligence, and is as smart and capable as you or I, and may even be able to speak. Regardless of the Broom’s intelligence, it does not count against your number of Companions. | Sorcerer’s Brooms, unlike other Brooms, have a Concentration, Evasion, and Vitality of (10 + (Rank x 2)). They can even use the “Strike” and “Sweep” Basic Attacks, rolling (3 + Rank + 2d6) To-Hit, and dealing ((Rank + 1) x 4) Blunt damage if the attack lands. Note that using this attack still consumes the Hero’s Standard Action. Thus, while Sorcerer’s Brooms can fight back on their own, they’re generally well outclassed by even a moderately skilled Hero. | Generally speaking, Sorcerer’s Brooms will object to being deconstructed. They may also take things too far or too literally when given orders. Be aware of the consequences when your Broom can think for itself! | . | Weatherproof: Select one type of Weather. This Broom, and all persons riding this Broom, treat that selected Weather as (Rank) Ranks lower when calculating its effect on them. This Personal Touch may be chosen multiple times, each time selecting a different Weather. | . ",

    "content": "Brooms, as a kind of unique vehicle, invite a certain level of complexity. By default, much of this complexity is pushed aside in the name of simple fun, as is the general style of Reclaim the Wild. However, if you wish to see Brooms be harder to pilot without practice, less maneuverable than a person on the ground, or even unrepairable at all, then read on. Unpracticed Pilot Penalty . You may wish for Broom-riding to be limited solely to Witches, something that most mundane folks can’t up-and-do, even if they somehow got their hands on a Witch’s Broom. If so, then this Master Mode rule is for you. For inexperienced Witches, Brooms can be a bit difficult to control, which can lead to them bumping into things, or even falling off their Broom. This is known as the Unpracticed Pilot Penalty: If the Broom’s pilot does not possess the Broomcraft feat (above), then at the end of their turn, they must roll as if they were on either a Slightly Slick surface (if they used half or less of the Broom’s Movement) or a Severely Slick surface (if they used more than half of the Broom’s Movement). This roll occurs even if the Broom’s pilot would otherwise be immune to Slick surfaces. Master Mode: Vehicular Movement . You may wish to treat Broom-riding more like riding a vehicle than like riding a mount. Perhaps you’d like to see Brooms have maneuverability concerns that companion mounts do not typically suffer from, such as difficulty making sharp turns while moving at full speed. With this Master Mode rule, Heroes riding Brooms will be less maneuverable than Heroes riding more traditional mounts. While on a Broom: . | Generally, you may only turn up to 90 degrees from your starting facing during a single turn on a Broom. This means you can end your turn facing ‘right’ or ‘left’ from where you were, but no more than that. | Before you make any movement, you may declare your Broom Slowed for the remainder of your turn. If you do so, you may turn up to 180 degrees from your starting facing while on the Broom. This means you can turn completely around over the course of your (Slowed!) turn. | If you Sprint (moving twice the Broom’s Movement), you cannot turn more than 45 degrees from your initial heading, give or take. This means Sprinting on a Broom is best used for a direct dash or charge, when you’re already lined up with where you need to be! . | . Irreparable Brooms . As a Master Mode rule, your GM may disallow Broom repair and upgrading. This brings Brooms into line with Weapons and most other equipment, which cannot be safely repaired unless inhabited by a Weapon Spirit. ",

You finish summoning the Phantom at the beginning of your next turn. By default, this Phantom is armed with an ephemeral sword and shield. The Phantom functions as a temporary Companion allied with you: you share your Actions with it, and it cannot act without your say-so. The Phantom has a Vulnerability to Light damage. Any damage done to the Phantom is instead Burned from your MP, after accounting for the Phantom’s Defense. If an attack would take you to 0 Magic or below, then any remaining damage after taking you to 0 Magic is done to your Health, and the Phantom disappears. (You may also dismiss the Phantom as a Free Action during your turn after you’ve summoned it; it cannot be dismissed on the same turn it is summoned.) However the Phantom is made to disappear, the Magic Bound in it is returned. When you finish summoning the Phantom (at the start of the turn after you cast this Spell), the Phantom may, as a Free Action, perform a Basic Attack, the Charge action, or the Defend action. It may take this Free Action before or after moving, as desired. The Phantom is of Limited intelligence. It can equip weapons and use most Tools, if directly told how to do so. It cannot craft items, speak with others, or think up new ideas on its own. Phantoms cannot equip armor (since they are made of armor). Phantoms do not know anything that their caster doesn’t know. Phantoms can perform simple actions, but not overly complex ones – roughly, they can do the kinds of things you could reasonably ask a silent, obedient child to do. For example, a Phantom can trot over to a Treasure Chest and open it (and even use a Small Key to do so), but it cannot pick the Chest’s lock or search it for traps. The Phantom is capable of using the Charge, Defend, Deflect, Intercept, and Parry actions, as well as the Basic Attacks appropriate to its wielded weapon(s), but it cannot use Spells or Techniques. The Phantom’s equipment is as ephemeral as it is; if the Phantom drops its sword or shield, those items will disappear at the end of its next turn. However, if you hand the Phantom other weapons to use, it may equip and wield that gear just like any Hero could. You may only have one Phantom summoned at a time. If you summon a second Phantom, your previous Phantom is automatically dispelled, as if you had dismissed it. The Phantom’s stats are based upon how much MP you Bind to it. The more MP Bound to the Phantom, the more powerful it is. | Defense: 6 + (3 * (MP Bound / 4)) | Evasion: 4 + (MP Bound / 4) | Concentration: 10 + (MP Bound / 4) | Vitality: 10 + (MP Bound / 2) | Strike To-Hit Roll: 3 + (MP Bound / 2) + 2d6 | Strike Damage: (MP Bound x 1.5), rounded down | Power Traits: (MP Bound / 2) | Courage and Wisdom Traits: (MP Bound / 4) | .

    "content": "The Phantom’s exact appearance is defined by you when you learn this spell. Typically, Phantoms appear as burly suits of armor, empty but for glowing eyes. The circumstances of how you learn the spell, or who you learn it from, might impact how your Phantom appears – as might its default equipment or its stat loadout. GMs may, as an option, allow the Hero learning the Zelda’s Phantom spell to wield a different set of default weapons. For instance, one Hero’s Phantom might use a Staff, while another might use a Bow. (If a Phantom uses a weapon that consumes Ammunition, such as a Bow or Crossbow, it can fire an infinite amount of generic shots. If you wanted it to use fancier ammo, like Fire Arrows, you’d need to obtain those elsewhere and then hand them to the Phantom once it’s summoned.) . Another option at the GM’s disposal is to alter the stats of the summoned Phantom. For instance, the Phantom might be a more nimble assassin-type rather than the classical heavily-armored warrior. Of course, the GM could decide to grant the Phantom even further modifications: an elemental theme, the benefits of some particular Race or monster, and so on. Below are two further stat-blocks for simple “Rogue” and “Wizard”-archetype Phantoms. They use different weapons, and have slightly different statistics, than the classic, heavily-armored “Fighter” archetype (above). Rogue . Wields a Dagger and Crossbow (and thus, is capable of using both the “Strike” and the “Shoot Arrow” Basic Attacks). | Defense: 4 + (2 * (MP Bound / 4)) | Evasion: 8 + (MP Bound / 2) | Concentration: 10 + (MP Bound / 3) | Vitality: 10 + (MP Bound / 3) | Basic Attack To-Hit Roll: 4 + (MP Bound / 2) + 2d6 | Basic Attack Damage: (MP Bound x 1.5), rounded down | Courage Traits: (MP Bound / 2) | Power and Wisdom Traits: (MP Bound / 4) | . Wizard . Wields a Staff (and thus, is capable of using the Basic Attack “Use Staff”). | Defense: 2 + (MP Bound / 4) | Evasion: 10 + (MP Bound / 4) | Concentration: 10 + (MP Bound / 2) | Vitality: 10 + (MP Bound / 4) | Basic Attack To-Hit Roll: 4 + (MP Bound / 2) + 2d6 | Basic Attack Damage: (MP Bound x 1.5), rounded down | Wisdom Traits: (MP Bound / 2) | Courage and Power Traits: (MP Bound / 4) | . Regardless of how the GM changes up the Spell, it should be considered a wholly separate Spell from any other instances of Zelda’s Phantom that a character knows. Once a Hero knows any version of Zelda’s Phantom, further variations should be considered 6-Token Spells, rather than 9-Token – after all, different types of Phantoms don’t offer quite as much additional utility as being able to summon one in the first place.
